3.0.1
Dependencies:
 - squidlib-util: RegExodus 0.1.10
 - squidlib: libGDX 1.9.11, anim8-gdx 0.2.0 
 - squidlib-extra: libGDX 1.9.11
Changes:
 - 5D noise has been added to fit in-between the existing 4D and 6D.
 - Lots of other noise stuff; FastNoise.HONEY may be useful, as may Noise.Maelstrom3D (or any D).
 - VastNoise is a drop-in replacement for FastNoise that is a little faster but uses an extra 1MB of memory (statically).
 - Thesaurus has an archive of 3.0.0's lexicon stored in the repo's archives/ folder; this can be loaded to replicate 3.0.0 Thesaurus results.
 - Some bug-fixes when wrapping IColoredStrings.
 - MathExtras has nice new features, like isqrt() for getting the square root of large longs precisely, and probit() to Gaussian-distribute 0-1 values.
