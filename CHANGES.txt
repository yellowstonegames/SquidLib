3.0.4-SNAPSHOT
Dependencies:
 - squidlib-util: RegExodus 0.1.12
 - squidlib: libGDX 1.10.0, anim8-gdx 0.2.8
 - squidlib-extra: libGDX 1.10.0
Changes:
 - BREAKING: AbstractRNG's code that generated longs in a bounded range had some issues, and so did RNG. Both have been fixed, which may change bounded long generation (which tends to be rare).
 - OpenSimplex2's "S" (smooth) and "F" (fast) versions have been added to SquidLib, though they have to "fake seeds" by sampling different coordinates for different seeds.
 - SEED BREAKING (unless you use an archive): Thesaurus can now generate vegetable names, and not just fruit.
 - Thesaurus also has a ZOMBIE mode, for the enlightened few of the walking dead that can murmur out partial sentences.
 - StrinkKit.appendJoined() methods simultaneously join items from an array or Collection and append them to a StringBuilder.
 - Some changes to SquidMouse, mostly for readability.
 - Speedup for NumberTools.atan2(), plus an implementation for atan() to round out the trigonometric functions.
 - Inconsolata LGC now has an MSDF version in the assets.

3.0.3
Dependencies:
 - squidlib-util: RegExodus 0.1.10
 - squidlib: libGDX 1.9.12, anim8-gdx 0.2.4
 - squidlib-extra: libGDX 1.9.12
Changes:
 - SEED BREAKING: SerpentDeepMapGenerator had a rare out-of-bounds crash issue that has been fixed, though this may change the output of that generator.
 - FakeLanguageGen can now detect some uncommon accents and remove them with its removeAccents() method; previously it could produce some accented vowels but not remove them.
 - New math stuff; MathExtras.barronSpline(), speedups to NumberTools.acos() and NumberTools.asin(), and so on.
 - Triangular-mapped blue noise is available in BlueNoise.TRI_NOISE, as well as in some methods there.
 - Cascadia Mono has been added to the assets as an MSDF font; it has a nice, comfortable and different look.

3.0.2
Dependencies:
 - squidlib-util: RegExodus 0.1.10
 - squidlib: libGDX 1.9.11, anim8-gdx 0.2.2
 - squidlib-extra: libGDX 1.9.11
Changes:
 - IMPORTANT: 3.0.2 fixes some critical incompatibilities in 3.0.1 with Java 7 and 8.
 - BREAKING: The behavior of IRNG.nextSignedInt() and IRNG.nextSignedLong() was buggy for negative bounds, and has been corrected, though this changes existing results.
 - SEED BREAKING: OrganicMapGenerator's implementation is completely different, and tends to produce better organic shapes.
 - SparseLayers.frontChars() is new, and lets you get a simple view of a SparseLayers to put in, say, a text file.

3.0.1
Dependencies:
 - squidlib-util: RegExodus 0.1.10
 - squidlib: libGDX 1.9.11, anim8-gdx 0.2.0
 - squidlib-extra: libGDX 1.9.11
Changes:
 - 5D noise has been added to fit in-between the existing 4D and 6D.
 - Lots of other noise stuff; FastNoise.HONEY may be useful, as may Noise.Maelstrom3D (or any D).
 - VastNoise is a drop-in replacement for FastNoise that is a little faster but uses an extra 1MB of memory (statically).
 - Thesaurus has an archive of 3.0.0's lexicon stored in the repo's archives/ folder; this can be loaded to replicate 3.0.0 Thesaurus results.
 - Some bug-fixes when wrapping IColoredStrings.
 - MathExtras has nice new features, like isqrt() for getting the square root of large longs precisely, and probit() to Gaussian-distribute 0-1 values.

3.0.0
Dependencies:
 - squidlib-util: RegExodus 0.1.10
 - squidlib: libGDX 1.9.11, anim8-gdx 0.1.6 
 - squidlib-extra: libGDX 1.9.11
Changes:
 - Everything.
 - Seriously, the library is unrecognizable when compared to 2.x.
