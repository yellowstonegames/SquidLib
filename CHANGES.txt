3.0.7-SNAPSHOT
Dependencies:
 - squidlib-util: RegExodus 0.1.15
 - squidlib: libGDX 1.12.0, anim8-gdx 0.4.2
 - squidlib-extra: libGDX 1.12.0
Changes:
 - BREAKING CHANGE, DEVELOPERS ONLY: Building SquidLib now requires your Java version to be between 11 and 19, inclusive. This does not affect library consumers.
 - A bug in SparseLayers was fixed that affected recallToGrid().
 - A long-standing bug in AOE code and CoordPacker was fixed that involved bitwise stuff (ints used where longs should have been instead).
 - Lots of Gradle changes, including an update to Gradle 8.4 and an update to the Vanniktech Maven Publish Plugin.

3.0.6
Dependencies:
 - squidlib-util: RegExodus 0.1.14
 - squidlib: libGDX 1.11.0, anim8-gdx 0.3.12
 - squidlib-extra: libGDX 1.11.0
Changes:
 - There's a lot of small updates here, but most of them only changed tests.
 - A very long-standing bug in DijkstraMap has been fixed; it affected how corners blocked (or didn't) movement.
 - Another bug was fixed in 4D ridged cubic noise using FastNoise, where I think it ignored the w axis.
 - 2D PhantomNoise using noise2D() was badly broken and now works.
 - The change to using lsans-15.png in libGDX is handled now in TextCellFactory.
 - There's probably a few more small things...

3.0.5
Dependencies:
 - squidlib-util: RegExodus 0.1.13
 - squidlib: libGDX 1.11.0, anim8-gdx 0.3.7
 - squidlib-extra: libGDX 1.11.0
Changes:
 - FloatFilters now implements several more of the effects from Filters, such as HallucinateFilter and WiggleFilter.
 - The new RNG types from jdkgdxds (used by SquidSquad) have been backported here, though using them in RNG could produce different results than as an EnhancedRandom from jdkgdxds.
 - HexagonalMap is a new option for WorldMapGenerator, and could be useful for games with hex grids.
 - BlueNoise now has "omni-tiling" noise textures it can use via getSeededOmniTiling() and getSeededTriOmniTiling(); these tile with all other textures in their group.
 - Various additions to noise functionality:
   - The new HappyPointHash is slightly faster and simpler than the previous-best HastyPointHash for long inputs.
   - UnifiedNoise cleans up the internals of SeededNoise in higher dimensions, and also uses HappyPointHash.
   - LumpNoise acts just like UnifiedNoise, but has configurable `harshness` that affects how starkly it changes from low to high.
   - Various experimental noise functions will probably be removed, such as FoalNoise, PyrNoise, PyrlinNoise, and WeavingNoise.
 - The IDistribution interface is now more explicit about its upper and lower bounds, and can provide a way to get the mean result.
 - KumaraswamyDistribution is a simple parameterizable distribution that can imitate the PDF/CDF of various other distributions.
 - TextCellFactory has adapted to the changes in the default font in libGDX 1.11.0, and functions correctly now when using the lsans-15 font included in libGDX.

3.0.4
Dependencies:
 - squidlib-util: RegExodus 0.1.12
 - squidlib: libGDX 1.10.0, anim8-gdx 0.2.10
 - squidlib-extra: libGDX 1.10.0
Changes:
 - BREAKING: AbstractRNG's code that generated longs in a bounded range had some issues, and so did RNG. Both have been fixed, which may change bounded long generation (which tends to be rare).
 - SEED BREAKING (unless you use an archive): Thesaurus can now generate vegetable, nut, shrub, and flower names, not just fruit.
 - SEED BREAKING: The Ridged subclasses of Noise now default to rotating octaves after the first, which helps avoid artifacts with several types of noise.
 - Continuing the above, FastNoise allows rotating later octaves with its "fractalSpiral" setting; it defaults to false (unchanged from earlier versions).
 - OpenSimplex2's "S" (smooth) and "F" (fast) versions have been added to SquidLib, though they have to "fake seeds" by sampling different coordinates for different seeds.
 - Thesaurus also has a ZOMBIE mode, for the enlightened few of the walking dead that can murmur out partial sentences.
 - StringKit.appendJoined() methods simultaneously join items from an array or Collection and append them to a StringBuilder.
 - Some changes to SquidMouse, mostly for readability.
 - Speedup for NumberTools.atan2(), plus an implementation for atan() to round out the trigonometric functions.
 - Inconsolata LGC now has an MSDF version in the assets.
 - Lots of improvements and small visual changes to existing fonts (mostly "stretchable" distance field fonts).
 - New features in Dice: you can store the data needed to describe a rule for rolling dice, to avoid parsing again.

3.0.3
Dependencies:
 - squidlib-util: RegExodus 0.1.10
 - squidlib: libGDX 1.9.12, anim8-gdx 0.2.4
 - squidlib-extra: libGDX 1.9.12
Changes:
 - SEED BREAKING: SerpentDeepMapGenerator had a rare out-of-bounds crash issue that has been fixed, though this may change the output of that generator.
 - FakeLanguageGen can now detect some uncommon accents and remove them with its removeAccents() method; previously it could produce some accented vowels but not remove them.
 - New math stuff; MathExtras.barronSpline(), speedups to NumberTools.acos() and NumberTools.asin(), and so on.
 - Triangular-mapped blue noise is available in BlueNoise.TRI_NOISE, as well as in some methods there.
 - Cascadia Mono has been added to the assets as an MSDF font; it has a nice, comfortable and different look.

3.0.2
Dependencies:
 - squidlib-util: RegExodus 0.1.10
 - squidlib: libGDX 1.9.11, anim8-gdx 0.2.2
 - squidlib-extra: libGDX 1.9.11
Changes:
 - IMPORTANT: 3.0.2 fixes some critical incompatibilities in 3.0.1 with Java 7 and 8.
 - BREAKING: The behavior of IRNG.nextSignedInt() and IRNG.nextSignedLong() was buggy for negative bounds, and has been corrected, though this changes existing results.
 - SEED BREAKING: OrganicMapGenerator's implementation is completely different, and tends to produce better organic shapes.
 - SparseLayers.frontChars() is new, and lets you get a simple view of a SparseLayers to put in, say, a text file.

3.0.1
Dependencies:
 - squidlib-util: RegExodus 0.1.10
 - squidlib: libGDX 1.9.11, anim8-gdx 0.2.0
 - squidlib-extra: libGDX 1.9.11
Changes:
 - 5D noise has been added to fit in-between the existing 4D and 6D.
 - Lots of other noise stuff; FastNoise.HONEY may be useful, as may Noise.Maelstrom3D (or any D).
 - VastNoise is a drop-in replacement for FastNoise that is a little faster but uses an extra 1MB of memory (statically).
 - Thesaurus has an archive of 3.0.0's lexicon stored in the repo's archives/ folder; this can be loaded to replicate 3.0.0 Thesaurus results.
 - Some bug-fixes when wrapping IColoredStrings.
 - MathExtras has nice new features, like isqrt() for getting the square root of large longs precisely, and probit() to Gaussian-distribute 0-1 values.

3.0.0
Dependencies:
 - squidlib-util: RegExodus 0.1.10
 - squidlib: libGDX 1.9.11, anim8-gdx 0.1.6 
 - squidlib-extra: libGDX 1.9.11
Changes:
 - Everything.
 - Seriously, the library is unrecognizable when compared to 2.x.
