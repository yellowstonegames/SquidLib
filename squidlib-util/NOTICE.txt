Thanks to TSMI and notostraca (Tommy Ettinger) of #rgrd for help in developing SquidLib.

Portions of Bresenham methods are derived from Bob Pendleton's C algorithm, which is in turn derived from Paul
Heckbert's algorithm ("Digital Line Drawing" from "Graphics Gems", Academic Press, 1990.

Portions of FOV and LOS classes are derived from works by Steven Blacken originally distributed as part of the Blacken
Library for roguelike games under the Apache 2.0 license.

Portions of some classes are derived from works by Jice originally distributed in the libtcod library under the BSD
license with the statement provided below in this document.

Portions of some classes are derived from works in the rot.js library with the statement provided below in this document.

The @Beta annotation is from Google's Guava library under the Apache 2.0 license; the @GwtIncompatible annotation is
probably from Google's GWT library or its documentation, but may also be from Guava.

The JRotation class (no longer in SquidLib) was based on code by Savvas Dalkitsis on stackoverflow.com.

The RNG class is based on the Mersenne Twister implementation by Daniel Dyer as part of the Uncommons Maths library,
which is in turn based on the original C algorithm by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura. Also from Uncommon Maths,
the CombinationGenerator and PermutationGenerator classes; changes were made to PermutationGenerator based on techniques
from user Joren on StackOverflow, http://stackoverflow.com/a/1506337 .

The squidpony.squidgrid.mapping.styled package and the JSON resources are derived from Sean T. Barrett's Herringbone
Wang Tiles library, part of the nothings set of libraries, which were released into the public domain.

The LightRNG class is based on SplitMix64.c by Sebastiano Vigna, released into the public domain and made available on
http://xorshift.di.unimi.it/

The XorRNG class is based on the C implementation of XorShift 128+ by Sebastiano Vigna, released into the public domain
and made available on http://xorshift.di.unimi.it/
LongPeriodRNG is based on XorShift 1024* , XoRoRNG is based on XoRoShiRo 64+ , and the other credit for these is the
same as XorRNG.

The PermutedRNG and PintRNG classes are based on the aforementioned SplitMix64.c by Sebastiano Vigna and on the paper,
http://www.pcg-random.org/paper.html , describing PCG-Random and its methodology written by Melissa E. O'Neill.

The SobolQRNG class and the resource in the resources/qrng folder were ported from Apache Commons Math, where Stephen
Joe and Frances Kuo are credited for the implementation.

The VanDerCorputQRNG class implements the sequence discovered by J.G. van der Corput in 1935, as well as the closely
related Halton sequence; no other previous code is used here.

The IsaacRNG class is based off a Java implementation given for the Isaac cipher/RNG (usable for either) from
http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html (public domain); the version uses here is a mix of the C code in
isaac64.c and the Java implementation by Bob Jenkins for 32-bit generation, and it produces 64 bits at a time in Java.

The JavaRNG class was contributed by Ben McLean to help compare the default JDK Random class with SquidLib's RNGs.

The NeuralParticle and WeightedLetterNamegen classes are based on work by Ebyan Alvarez-Buylla .

ShortSet, ShortVLA, IntVLA, and SparseTextMap are based closely off primitive-backed collections from libGDX,
Apache-licensed.

IntDoubleOrderedMap, OrderedMap, and OrderedSet are based on similar code from Sebastiano Vigna's fastutil library,
https://github.com/vigna/fastutil . Arrangement, K2, and K2V1 have been based on those.

The DijkstraMap class is original but owes substantial credit to Edsger Dijkstra
for creating the algorithm that shares his name, Brian Pender and Joshua Day for
pioneering Progressive Dijkstra Scan, and the IRC user known as kaw for a
Clojure-language implementation that would help shape this design, which is, it
turns out, subtly different from Dijkstra's Pathfinding Algorithm and is closer
to Breadth-First Search, though it still produces what is usually called a
Dijkstra Map by roguelike developers.

The Spill class derives much of its implementation from DijkstraMap but also from techniques Joshua Day described for
using randomized floodfill and a Lua implementation related to his postings on the subject.

The SoundMap class also derives much of its implementation from DijkstraMap but
is otherwise practically novel.

The squidpony.squidai.AOE interface and its implementing classes are essentially
made possible by the Progressive Dijkstra Scan technique, so more thanks must go
to Brian Pender and Joshua Day.

The hashing techniques used in CrossHash are not derived (at least not
intentionally) from any other hashing algorithms; earlier versions contained
code derived from FNV-1a and Daniel Lemire's StronglyUniversalStringHashing projects.

The phonetic locality-sensitive hashing of word sounds in NaturalLanguageCipher
owes some credit to eudex, a Rust library for the same type of hashing which can
be found at https://github.com/ticki/eudex , because eudex showed there was
(more than one) way to encode a word sound approximately in 64 bits. No code is
shared between eudex and SquidLib, however.

Small but important bugfixes and additions were contributed by Ivan Polozhēntsev
( https://github.com/uzername/ , introduced the concept and some code for
SquidKeys.ignoreInput), David Becker (found and fixed several GDX-related bugs),
and Shane Chubb (found and fixed a bug in the LibGDX TextCellFactory).
This is not a complete list of bugfix contributors.

MixedGenerator is an extension and port of Drunkard's Walk dungeon generation code
written by Michael Patraw; a more recent version of his code is available at
https://github.com/mpatraw/butterfly . The version SquidLib extended was older and
any newer code should probably derive from butterfly instead. Several other classes
make use of MixedGenerator, and the Drunkard's Walk technique is very versatile.

MimicFill and DetailedMimic are direct ports of https://github.com/mxgmn/ConvChain and
https://github.com/mxgmn/SynTex from C# to Java; the former is public domain while the
latter is MIT-licensed.

A substantial amount of work on SquidLib has been done by smelC, https://github.com/smelc ,
especially in the areas of color handling, text layout, and shape analysis for dungeons.
His help has been very welcome in helping to manage the growing codebase and to keep
complex code clean and robust, as well.

All of the TrueType and bitmap fonts in the assets directory of the source tree were made by Tommy
Ettinger and released into the public domain, except:

  * Inconsolata and the fonts based on it (all containing Inconsolata in their filename are derived from Raph
    Levien's work as modified in https://github.com/MihailJP/Inconsolata-LGC , all with SIL OFL as their license
    and any alterations made here do not change the original work's licensing). Portions of the fonts derived
    from Inconsolata also incorporate glyphs from DejaVu Sans Mono, http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page ,
    which has a different license but our usage seems to be specifically allowed on their license page,
    http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/License :
    ```
    The Font Software may be modified, altered, or added to, and in particular the designs of glyphs or
    characters in the Fonts may be modified and additional glyphs or characters may be added to the Fonts,
    only if the fonts are renamed to names not containing either the words "Bitstream" or the word "Vera".
    ```
  * DejaVu Sans Mono is also present in DejaVuSansMono-distance.png; a license accompanies it in the same folder.
  * Iosevka has several variants in the assets folder, including Iosevka and Iosevka Slab, all of which have the
    same license (SIL OFL 1.1); this license accompanies the fonts wherever they are.
  * The fonts containing CM-Custom in their names are modified from Computer Modern Unicode, also SIL OFL, and
    the originals, plus some related fonts, can be found at https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/cmu-typewriter .
    They were originally the work of Donald Knuth for the TeX typesetting system.
  * Gentium is SIL OFL, originally by SIL, and has had minimal modification, if any. The original site is
    http://software.sil.org/gentium/ .
  * Noto Sans is SIL OFL, originally by Google, Inc., and has had minimal modification. The original files, as
    well as Noto Serif and specialized versions, can be obtained from https://www.google.com/get/noto/ .
  * Orbitron is SIL OFL 1.1, originally by The League of Movable Type, and can be obtained from
    http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/12-orbitron .
  * The .png images containing the name Tentacle are public domain, originally by Henrique Lazarini (also known
    as 7Soul1, http://7soul1.deviantart.com/ ); some have modifications applied to a vector trace of the
    original pixel art.
  * icons.png is derived from the many icons supplied by http://game-icons.net/ ; it has its own license and
    people to credit in a file distributed with it, icons-license.txt .
  * BoxedIn is Creative Commons Zero-licensed, originally by FontStruct user samw3.
