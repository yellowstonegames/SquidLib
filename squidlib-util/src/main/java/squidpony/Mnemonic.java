/**
 * A utility class to print (typically very large) numbers in a way that players can more-meaningfully tell them apart.
 * It isn't that great for this task currently, but it can bi-directionally turn {@code long} values like
 * -8798641734435409502 into {@code String}s like nwihyayeetyoruehyazuetro. The advantage here is that
 * nwihyayeetyoruehyazuetro is very different from protoezlebauyauzlutoatra, even though the numbers they are made from
 * are harder to distinguish (-8798641734435409502 vs. -8032477240987739423, when using the default seed).
 * <br>
 * The constructor optionally takes a seed that can greatly change the generated mnemonics, which may be useful if
 * mnemonic strings produced for some purpose should only be decipherable by that program or that play of the game. If
 * no seed is given, this acts as if the seed is 1. Only 256 possible 3-letter sections are used with any given seed,
 * but 431 sections are possible (hand-selected to avoid the likelihood of producing possibly-vulgar words). Two
 * different seeds may use mostly-different selections of "syllable" sections, though a not-very-small amount of overlap
 * in potential generated mnemonic strings must occur between any two seeds.
