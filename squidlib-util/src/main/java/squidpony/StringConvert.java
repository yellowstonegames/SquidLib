/**
 * Used to standardize conversion for a given type, {@code T}, to and from a serialized String format.
 * This abstract class should usually be made concrete by a single-purpose class (not the type T itself).
 * Also includes a static registry of types as CharSequence arrays (including the classes of generic type parameters in
 * array elements after the first) to the  corresponding StringConvert objects that have been constructed for those
 * types, although the registry must store the StringConvert objects without any further types (you can cast the
 * StringConvert to a StringConvert with the desired generic type, or call {@link #restore(String)} on the
 * un-parametrized type and get back an Object that can be cast to the correct type, but we aren't able to store the
 * actual type). The static method {@link #lookup(CharSequence[])} can be used to find the StringConvert registered for
 * a type name combination. The static method {@link #get(CharSequence)} can be used to find a StringConvert by its
 * name. The static utility method {@link #asArray(CharSequence[])} can be used to reduce the amount of arrays produced
 * by varargs, especially when you have a bunch of Class items and need Strings, but the array it returns must not be
 * edited once used to construct a StringConvert.
