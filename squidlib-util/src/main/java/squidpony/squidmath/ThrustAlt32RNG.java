/**
 * A variant on {@link ThrustAltRNG} that uses only 32-bit math when producing 32-bit numbers. This generator does as
 * well as you could hope for on statistical tests, considering it can only generate 2 to the 32 ints before repeating
 * the cycle. You may want to consider {@link Zag32RNG} if roughly 4 billion numbers could be produced by your game or
 * application (if you just generated random ints, you could exhaust that amount in seconds). On
 * <a href="http://pracrand.sourceforge.net/">PractRand</a>, this completes testing on 16GB of generated ints (the
 * amount of space all possible ints would use) without finding any failures. Some big-name number generators sometimes
 * fail PractRand tests at only 256 MB, so this should be pretty good, except that this generator isn't capable of
 * producing all ints, and is only capable of producing a tiny fraction of all possible longs (less than 2 to the 32
 * possible longs can be generated). Like ThrustAltRNG and LightRNG, this changes its state with a steady fixed
 * increment, and does cipher-like adjustments to the current state to randomize it, although the changes here are
 * necessarily more involved than those in ThrustAltRNG because there are less bits of state to use to randomize output.
 * The period on ThrustAlt32RNG is 2 to the 32.Changing the seed even slightly generally produces completely different
 * results, which applies primarily to determine() but also the first number generated in a series of nextInt() calls.
 * <br>
 * This generator is meant to function the same on GWT as on desktop, server, or Android JREs, and unlike
 * some earlier generators, the implementation of ints on GWT is accounted for here. On GWT, ints are
 * just JavaScript doubles, and can go beyond the typical range of an int without overflowing but are locked back down
 * into the 32-bit signed integer range when bitwise operations are used. To make sure multiplication stays within the
 * precise range for JavaScript doubles (with a maximum of 2 to the 53), any multiplications are limited to at most
 * 32 bit (signed) numbers times 21 bit (effectively unsigned) numbers. This class is also super-sourced on GWT with an
 * alternate implementation that replaces {@code foo += bar} with the normally-pointless {@code foo = foo + bar | 0}; on
 * GWR this enforces overflow wrapping to the int range, and similar bitwise code is used elsewhere in the super-sourced
 * version. This should be enough to ensure consistent behavior across platforms. The same techniques are used by
 * various other GWT-safe RNGs, such as {@link GWTRNG}, which uses the same algorithm as {@link Starfish32RNG}, and that
 * algorithm is currently preferred to the one here because either of those classes can produce all possible ints with
 * nextInt() but also all possible longs (except one) with nextLong().
