/**
 * Mersenne Twister, 64-bit version as a RandomnessSource.
 * <br>
 * Similar to the regular 32-bit Mersenne Twister but implemented with 64-bit
 * values (Java <code>long</code>), and with different output. This generator is probably
 * not the best to use because of known statistical problems and low speed, but its period
 * is absurdly high, {@code pow(2, 19937) - 1}. {@link LongPeriodRNG} has significantly
 * better speed and statistical quality, and also has a large period, {@code pow(2, 1024) - 1}.
 * {@link IsaacRNG} is slower, but offers impeccable quality, and from its webpage, "Cycles
 * are guaranteed to be at least {@code pow(2, 40)} values long, and they are
 * {@code pow(2, 8295)} values long on average." IsaacRNG should be your choice if security is a
 * concern, LongPeriodRNG if quality and speed are important, and MersenneTwister should be used
 * if period is the only criterion to judge an RNG on. Keep in mind that extremely long periods
 * are not always a good thing; there are known states for the Mersenne Twister that produce dozens
 * of {@code 0} outputs in a row, which is fundamentally impossible for {@link LightRNG} or
 * {@link DiverRNG}. It also would take longer to exhaust the period of a 128-bit-state generator
 * (generating 100 gigabytes per second) than the amount of time humans have walked the Earth.
 * This has 19968 bits of state... so if 128 is more than is possible to exhaust, why do you need
 * 19968 bits, again? Consider {@link GoatRNG} if you want a high-quality 128-bit generator.
 * <br>
 * This is mostly a straight port of the
 * <a href="http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/VERSIONS/C-LANG/mt19937-64.c">
 * C-code (mt19937-64.c)</a>, but made more "java-like". This version was originally found
