/**
 * Permutation generator for generating all permutations for all sets up to
 * 20 elements in size.  While 20 may seem a low limit, bear in mind that
 * the number of permutations of a set of size n is n!  For a set of 21
 * items, the number of permutations is bigger than can be stored in Java's
 * 64-bit long integer data type.  Therefore it seems unlikely that you
 * could ever generate, let alone process, all of the permutations in a
 * reasonable time frame.  For this reason the implementation is optimised for
 * sets of size 20 or less (this affords better performance by allowing primitive
 * numeric types to be used for calculations rather than
 * {@link java.math.BigInteger}).
