/**
 * A modification of Blackman and Vigna's xoroshiro128+ generator using two 32-bit ints of state instead of two 64-bit
 * longs, as well as modifying the output with two additional operations on the existing state; this is both the fastest
 * generator on GWT I have found without statistical failures, and a StatefulRandomness. This algorithm is sometimes
 * called xoroshiro64++ and is mentioned in <a href="http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/ScrambledLinear.pdf">this paper
 * by Blackman and Vigna</a> (in section 10.7; the 'r' constant is 10, which seems to usually do well on those same
 * authors' HWD test). Lathe32RNG passes the full 32TB battery of PractRand's statistical tests, and does so with 3
 * "unusual" anomalies, no more-serious anomalies, and no failures. It isn't especially likely that this can pass much
 * more than 32TB of testing (judging by related attempts, 128TB would be a likely failure point), but because
 * multi-threaded code is either impossible or impractical on GWT, actually using that many numbers would take a very
 * long time (generating them would take about 3 nanoseconds per int, but it would take more than 2 to the 43 ints to
 * start to approach detectable failures, and detecting the failures in anything but the worst case would take more than
 * a day). In statistical testing, xoroshiro with the '+' scrambler always fails some binary matrix rank tests, but
 * smaller-state versions fail other tests as well. The changes Lathe makes apply only to the output of xoroshiro64+ (in
 * Vigna's and Blackman's terms, they are a scrambler), not its well-tested state transition, and these changes
 * eliminate all statistical failures on 32TB of tested data, avoiding the failures the small-state variant of xoroshiro
 * suffers on BinaryRank, BCFN, DC6, and FPF. It avoids multiplication (except in {@link #setSeed(int)}, which needs to
 * use a different algorithm to spread a seed out across twice as much state), like xoroshiro and much of the xorshift
 * family of generators, and any arithmetic it performs is safe for GWT. Lathe makes an extremely small set of changes
 * to xoroshiro64+, running xoroshiro64+ as normal (holding on to the result as well as the initial stateA, called s[0]
 * in the original xoroshiro code) and then bitwise-rotating the result and adding the (now previous) stateA. Although
 * no bits of xoroshiro are truly free of artifacts, some are harder to find issues with
 * (see <a href="http://www.pcg-random.org/posts/xoroshiro-fails-truncated.html">this article by PCG-Random's author</a>
 * for more detail). It is unclear if the changes made here would improve the larger-state version, but they probably
 * would help to some extent with at least the binary rank failures. The period is identical to xoroshiro with two
 * 32-bit states, at 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF or 2 to the 64 minus 1. This generator is slightly slower than xoroshiro without
 * the small extra steps applied to the output, but about as fast as {@link Oriole32RNG} (this has a smaller period and
 * smaller state but implements StatefulRandomness). Some simple tests on bytes instead of ints showed that the
 * technique used here produces all possible bytes with equal frequency when run on bytes as state, with the exception
 * of producing 0 one less time (because both states cannot be 0 at the same time). This gives some confidence for the
 * algorithm used here, but the algorithm is still only one-dimensionally equidistributed (the same as xoroshiro128+),
 * meaning it produces some pairs of ints more frequently than others. You may want to prefer {@link Starfish32RNG},
 * which is the current default in {@link GWTRNG}, because it can produce all pairs of ints and all longs (except one),
 * and has noticeably better quality even on some short generated sequences.
 * <br>
 * The name comes from a tool that rotates very quickly to remove undesirable parts of an object, akin to how this
 * generator adds an extra bitwise rotation to xoroshiro64+ to remove several types of
 * undesirable statistical failures from its test results.
 * <br>
 * <a href="http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/xoroshiro128plus.c">Original version here for xorshiro128+</a>; this version
 * uses <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/prng/Ll-KDIbpO8k/bfHK4FlUCwAJ">different constants</a> by the same
 * author, Sebastiano Vigna. It does not use <a href="http://xoshiro.di.unimi.it/xoroshiro64star.c">the constants used
 * in other xoroshiro64 scrambled generators</a>, instead using similar-quality ones from the earlier constants link.
