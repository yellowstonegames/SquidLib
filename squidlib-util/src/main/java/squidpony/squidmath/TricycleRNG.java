/**
 * A RandomnessSource with three {@code long} states that changes its state with three ways it can connect states to
 * other states. This has been backported from jdkgdxds, which got this from SquidSquad originally. This generator has
 * an unknown period that is statistically extremely likely to be very long (more than 2 to the 64), and no combinations
 * of states are known that put it in a bad starting state or one with a shorter period. It is a very fast generator,
 * particularly on Java 16 and newer. It has passed 64TB of PractRand testing with no anomalies, and 4PB of hwd testing.
 * <br>
 * TricycleRNG, it's got three states and it cycles changes between them.
