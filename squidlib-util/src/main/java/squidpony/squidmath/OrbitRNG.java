/**
 * A variant on {@link ThrustAltRNG} that gives up some speed to gain a much better period and the ability to produce
 * all possible long values over that period. Its period is 2 to the 128, and it produces all long outputs with equal
 * likelihood. OrbitRNG is close to ThrustAltRNG in implementation, and ThrustAltRNG passes PractRand and TestU01 just
 * fine, but OrbitRNG should actually be more robust. For some purposes you may want to instead consider
 * {@link TangleRNG}, which also has two states and uses a very similar algorithm, but it skips some work Orbit does and
 * in doing so speeds up a lot and drops its period down to 2 to the 64. An individual TangleRNG can't produce all
 * possible long outputs and can produce some duplicates, but each pair of states for a TangleRNG has a different set of
 * which outputs will be skipped and which will be duplicated. Since it would require months of solid number generation
 * to exhaust the period of a TangleRNG, and that's the only time an output can be confirmed as skipped, it's probably
 * fine for some usage to use many different TangleRNGs, all seeded differently. In other cases you could use just one
 * OrbitRNG; its period is large enough not to worry about exhausting it in a game, though it isn't quite as fast as
 * TangleRNG. Orbit is extremely close in speed to a 64-bit variant on {@link Lathe32RNG}, and should have similarly
 * high quality; it should be slightly slower than {@link XoRoRNG} but doesn't fail the statistical tests that XoRo
 * fails rather badly.
 * <br>
 * The name comes from how the pair of states act like two planets orbiting a star at different rates, and also evokes
 * the larger-scale period relative to {@link TangleRNG}.
