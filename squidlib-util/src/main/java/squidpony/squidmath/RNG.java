/**
 * A wrapper class for working with random number generators in a more friendly way.
 * Implements {@link IRNG}, which covers most of the API surface, but RNG implements
 * a decent amount of additional methods. You should consider if your code needs
 * these additional methods, and if not you should use IRNG as the type for when you
 * need some random number generator.
 * <p>
 * Includes methods for getting values between two numbers and for getting
 * random elements from a collection or array. There are methods to shuffle
 * a collection and to get a random ordering that can be applied as one shuffle
 * across multiple collections, such as via {@link OrderedMap#reorder(int...)},
 * {@link ArrayTools#reorder(ArrayList, int...)}, and so on. You can construct
 * an RNG with all sorts of RandomnessSource implementations, and choosing them
 * is usually not a big concern because the default works very well. If you target
 * GWT, then it is suggested that you use {@link GWTRNG} instead of RNG; both
 * implement {@link IRNG}, which is enough for most usage across SquidLib, but
 * GWTRNG is optimized heavily for better performance on GWT, even returning long
 * values faster than implementations that natively do their math on longs. It has
 * worse performance on 64-bit PCs and mobile devices, but should also have better
 * performance on 32-bit PCs and mobile devices.
 * <br>
 * But if you do want advice on what RandomnessSource to use... {@link LinnormRNG}
 * is the default, and is the fastest generator that passes stringent tests, but
 * relative to many of the others it has a significantly shorter period (the
 * amount of random  numbers it will go through before repeating the sequence),
 * at {@code pow(2, 64)} as opposed to {@link XoRoRNG}'s {@code pow(2, 128) - 1},
 * or {@link LongPeriodRNG}'s {@code pow(2, 1024) - 1}. {@link LightRNG} is a solid
 * choice and the former default RandomnessSource; additional features of LightRNG
 * are exposed in {@link MoonwalkRNG} and using MoonwalkRNG is recommended if you
 * need unusual features like skipping backwards in a random number sequence, taking
 * a result of a nextLong() call and reversing it to get the state that produced it,
 * or calculating the distance in number of nextLong() calls between two results of
 * nextLong() calls. LightRNG is a StatefulRandomness, which lets it be used in
 * {@link StatefulRNG}, and so is LinnormRNG, but LightRNG is also a
 * {@link SkippingRandomness}, which means you can leap forward or backwards in
 * its sequence very efficiently (LinnormRNG is not a SkippingRandomness).
 * {@link ThrustAltRNG} provides similar qualities to LightRNG,
 * and can be faster, but can't produce all possible 64-bit values (possibly some 32-bit
 * values as well); it was the default at one point so you may want to keep compatibility
 * with some versions by specifying ThrustAltRNG (before and after ThrustAltRNG was the
 * default, LightRNG was used). For most cases, you should decide between
 * LinnormRNG, ThrustAltRNG, LightRNG, LongPeriodRNG, and XoRoRNG based on your priorities.
 * LinnormRNG is the best if you want high speed, very good quality of randomness, and
 * expect to either generate less than 18446744073709551616 numbers or don't care if
 * patterns appear after you generate that many numbers. LightRNG is the second-best at
 * the above criteria, but is the best option if you need an RNG that can skip backwards
 * or jump forwards without incurring speed penalties. LongPeriodRNG is best if you for some
 * reason need a massive amount of random numbers (as in, ten quintillion would be far too
 * little) or want to split up such a large generator into unrelated subsequences. XoRoRNG
 * is best if you want good speed and quality but need to generate more than
 * 18446744073709551616 numbers, though less than 340282366920938463463374607431768211456
 * numbers. ThrustAltRNG is faster than LinnormRNG usually, but its inability to generate
 * some outputs may make it a poor choice for some usage (it also has some bias toward
 * specific numbers and produces them more frequently, but not frequently enough to make it
 * fail statistical tests). {@link JabRNG} and {@link LapRNG} are competitors in the
 * no-quality-guarantees department; JabRNG is slightly slower than LapRNG but faster than
 * ThrustAltRNG, actually can pass a fair amount of quality tests, and can't produce a
 * majority of all possible 64-bit values. Its period is half that of ThrustAltRNG and
 * LightRNG, at 2 to the 63. LapRNG doesn't pass any tests, really, but it can fool a human
 * observer; its period is probably 2 to the 65 and it's incredibly fast but offers no
 * special features.
 * <br>
 * There are many more RandomnessSource implementations! You might want significantly less
 * predictable random results, which  {@link IsaacRNG} can provide, along with a
 * large period. The quality of {@link PermutedRNG} is also good, usually, and it
 * has a sound basis in PCG-Random, an involved library with many variants on its
 * RNGs.
 * There may be reasons why you would want a random number generator that uses 32-bit
 * math instead of the more common 64-bit math, but using a 32-bit int on desktop and
 * Android won't act the same as that same 32-bit int on GWT. Since GWT is stuck with
 * JavaScript's implementation of ints with doubles, overflow (which is needed for an
 * RNG) doesn't work with ints as expected, but does with GWT's implementation of longs.
 * If targeting GWT, {@link Lathe32RNG} is significantly faster at producing int values
 * than any long-based generator, and will produce the same results on GWT as on desktop
 * or Android (not all 32-bit generators do this). {@link Starfish32RNG} goes one step
 * further than Lathe32RNG at an even distribution, and has better quality, but is
 * slightly slower. While Lathe32RNG can produce all ints over the course of its period,
 * it will produce some pairs of ints, or longs, more often than others and will never
 * produce some longs. Starfish32RNG will produce all longs but one. {@link ThrustAlt32RNG},
 * {@link Zag32RNG}, and {@link Oriole32RNG} are also GWT-safe, but other generators that
 * were thought to be GWT-friendly are not. These GWT-unsafe generators have other uses,
 * but should not be used on GWT: {@link PintRNG} and {@link FlapRNG}. All other generators
 * use longs, and so will be slower than the recommended Starfish32RNG or Lathe32RNG on GWT,
 * but much faster on 64-bit JREs.
