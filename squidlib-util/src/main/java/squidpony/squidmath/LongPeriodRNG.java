/**
 * An RNG that has a drastically longer period than the other generators in SquidLib, other than {@link IsaacRNG},
 * without sacrificing speed or GWT support. If you don't already know what the period of an RNG is, this probably
 * isn't needed for your purposes, or many purposes in games at all. It is primarily meant for applications that need to
 * generate massive amounts of random numbers, more than pow(2, 64) (18,446,744,073,709,551,616), without repeating
 * the sequence of generated numbers. An RNG's period refers to the number of numbers it generates given a single
 * seed before the sequence repeats from the beginning. The period of this class is pow(2, 1024) minus 1
 * (179,769,313,486,231,590,772,930,519,078,902,473,361,797,697,894,230,657,273,430,081,157,732,675,805,500,963,132,708,
 * 477,322,407,536,021,120,113,879,871,393,357,658,789,768,814,416,622,492,847,430,639,474,124,377,767,893,424,865,485,
 * 276,302,219,601,246,094,119,453,082,952,085,005,768,838,150,682,342,462,881,473,913,110,540,827,237,163,350,510,684,
 * 586,298,239,947,245,938,479,716,304,835,356,329,624,224,137,215). While that number is preposterously large, there's
 * always some application that seems to need more; if you really need more than that, look into CMWC generators, which
 * can have even larger state and also even larger periods. There isn't one of those in SquidLib currently, though there
 * is a possibility of one being added in the future. There is a 64-bit MersenneTwister, which has an even larger period
 * than this one, but it might not have optimal quality for some applications (notably, the game Dungeon Crawl Stone
 * Soup used Mersenne Twister and found that some players in a competition could predict impending random events,
 * despite the generator seeming bulletproof).
 * <br>
 * This class may be particularly useful in conjunction with the shuffle method of RNG; the period of an RNG determines
 * how many possible "shuffles", a.k.a orderings or permutations, can be produced over all calls to a permuting method
 * like shuffle. A LightRNG-backed RNG with a period of pow(2, 64) will only be able to produce all possible "shuffles"
 * for lists or arrays of 20 items or less. If a LongPeriodRNG is given to the constructor of an RNG and a large enough
 * state has been given to the LongPeriodRNG (the String or long[] constructors can allow this), then lists or arrays of
 * up to 170 elements can have all possible orderings produced by shuffle(), though it will take near-impossibly-many
 * calls. This class has 128 bytes of state plus more in overhead (compare to the 16-byte-with-overhead LightRNG), but
 * due to its massive period and createMany() static method, you can create a large number of subsequences with rather
 * long periods themselves from a single seed. This uses the xorshift-1024*phi algorithm, and has competitive speed.
 * <br>
 * This generator was updated to the "phi" variant of XorShift1024* instead of the "M_8" variant when the phi variant
 * became recommended over the version this originally used. The multiplier, and thus the sequence of numbers this
 * generates for a given seed, changed on October 19, 2017.
