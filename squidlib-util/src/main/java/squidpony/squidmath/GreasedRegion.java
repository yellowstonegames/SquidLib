/**
 * Region encoding of on/off information about areas using bitsets; uncompressed (fatty), but fast (greased lightning).
 * This can handle any size of 2D data, and is not strictly limited to 256x256 as CoordPacker is. It stores several long
 * arrays and uses each bit in one of those numbers to represent a single point, though sometimes this does waste bits
 * if the height of the area this encodes is not a multiple of 64 (if you store a 80x64 map, this uses 80 longs; if you
 * store an 80x65 map, this uses 160 longs, 80 for the first 64 rows and 80 more to store the next row). It's much
 * faster than CoordPacker at certain operations (anything that expands or retracts an area, including
 * {@link #expand()}), {@link #retract()}), {@link #fringe()}), {@link #surface()}, and {@link #flood(GreasedRegion)},
 * and slightly faster on others, like {@link #and(GreasedRegion)} (called intersectPacked() in CoordPacker) and
 * {@link #or(GreasedRegion)} (called unionPacked() in CoordPacker).
 * <br>
 * Each GreasedRegion is mutable, and instance methods typically modify that instance and return it for chaining. There
 * are exceptions, usually where multiple GreasedRegion values are returned and the instance is not modified.
 * <br>
 * Typical usage involves constructing a GreasedRegion from some input data, like a char[][] for a map or a double[][]
 * from DijkstraMap, and modifying it spatially with expand(), retract(), flood(), etc. It's common to mix in data from
 * other GreasedRegions with and() (which gets the intersection of two GreasedRegions and stores it in one), or() (which
 * is like and() but for the union), xor() (like and() but for exclusive or, finding only cells that are on in exactly
 * one of the two GreasedRegions), and andNot() (which can be considered the "subtract another region from me" method).
 * There are 8-way (Chebyshev distance) variants on all of the spatial methods, and methods without "8way" in the name
 * are either 4-way (Manhattan distance) or not affected by distance measurement. Once you have a GreasedRegion, you may
 * want to:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>get a single random point from it (use {@link #singleRandom(IRNG)}),</li>
 *     <li>get several random points from it with random sampling (use {@link #randomPortion(IRNG, int)}),</li>
 *     <li>mutate the current GreasedRegion to keep random points from it with random sampling (use {@link #randomRegion(IRNG, int)}),</li>
 *     <li>get random points that are likely to be separated (use {@link #mixedRandomSeparated(double, int, long)} with
 *     a random long for the last parameter, or {@link #quasiRandomSeparated(double)} if you don't want a random seed),</li>
 *     <li>do what any of the above "separated" methods can do, but mutate the current GreasedRegion (use
 *     {@link #mixedRandomRegion(double, int, long)} or {@link #quasiRandomRegion(double, int)}),</li>
 *     <li>get all points from it (use {@link #asCoords()} to get a Coord array, or produce a 2D array of the contents
 *     with {@link #decode()} or {@link #toChars(char, char)}),</li>
 *     <li>use it to modify other 2D data, such as with {@link #mask(char[][], char)},
 *     {@link #inverseMask(char[][], char)}, {@link #writeDoubles(double[][], double)}, or
 *     {@link #writeIntsInto(int[][], int)}, along with variations on those.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * You may also want to produce some 2D data from one or more GreasedRegions, as with {@link #sum(GreasedRegion...)} or
 * {@link #toChars()}. The most effective techniques regarding GreasedRegion involve multiple methods, like getting a
 * few random points from an existing GreasedRegion representing floor tiles in a dungeon with
 * {@link #randomRegion(IRNG, int)}, then finding a random expansion of those initial points with
 * {@link #spill(GreasedRegion, int, IRNG)}, giving the original GreasedRegion of floor tiles as the first argument.
 * This could be used to position puddles of water or toxic waste in a dungeon level, while still keeping the starting
 * points and finished points within the boundaries of valid (floor) cells. If you wanted to place something like mold
 * that can be on floors or on cells immediately adjacent to floors (like walls), you could call {@link #expand()} on
 * the floor tiles before calling spill, allowing the spill to spread onto non-floor cells that are next to floors.
 * <br>
 * For efficiency, you can place one GreasedRegion into another (typically a temporary value that is no longer needed
 * and can be recycled) using {@link #remake(GreasedRegion)}, or give the information that would normally be used to
 * construct a fresh GreasedRegion to an existing one of the same dimensions with {@link #refill(boolean[][])} or any
 * of the overloads of refill(). These re-methods don't do as much work as a constructor does if the width and height
 * of their argument are identical to their current width and height, and don't create more garbage for the GC.

     * random instead of pseudo-random because it is somewhat less likely to produce nearby cells in the result. If you
     * request too many cells (too high of a value for fraction), it will start to overlap, however. Contrast with
     * {@link #mixedRandomRegion(double, int)}, which tends to overlap more frequently. This method seems to work
     * well because it chooses quasi-random points by their index in the Z-Order Curve as opposed to the simpler
     * approach mixedRandomRegion uses to traverse points (which just runs through the "on" cells a column at a time,
     * not caring if two points are in adjacent cells as long as they are in different columns). Testing with a dungeon
     * layout of mostly-on cells, this method has no overlap with a fraction of 0.4, while mixedRandomRegion has
     * overlap as early as 0.15 for fraction, and it only gets worse at higher values. A change to the algorithm used by
     * {@link #quasiRandomRegion(double, int)} has it overlapping at the same rate as this method, though it should be
     * much faster. This method can be especially slow, since each Z-Order traversal may need to try many cells that
     * are outside the GreasedRegion but are on the Z-Order Curve.
     * Restricts the total size of the returned array to a maximum of {@code limit} (minimum is 0 if no cells are "on").
     * If limit is negative, this will not restrict the size.
