/**
 * A technique for producing organic-seeming patterns via iterative processing of random values (reaction-diffusion).
 * The fundamental basis for why this looks organic should be credited to Alan Turing, but the specific algorithm should
 * be credited to <a href="http://www.jonathanmccabe.com/Cyclic_Symmetric_Multi-Scale_Turing_Patterns.pdf">Jonathan
 * McCabe</a>, who has produced significant expansions on the scope the original Turing work covered; you can see
 * <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonathanmccabe/sets>various examples of art he produced using this and related
 * techniques</a>.
 * <br>
 * This class tries to provide a fairly raw API so different adjustments can be made on top of it.
