/**
 * A generic insertion-ordered hash map with with a fast implementation, originally from fastutil as
 * Object2ObjectLinkedOpenHashMap but modified to support constant-time indexed access of keys, values, and entries,
 * reordering, and optional hash strategies for unusual keys, such as arrays or usually-dense numeric values.
 * <br>
 * Instances of this class use a hash table to represent a map. The table is filled up to a specified <em>load factor</em>, and then doubled in size to accommodate new entries. If the table is
 * emptied below <em>one fourth</em> of the load factor, it is halved in size. However, halving is not performed when deleting entries from an iterator, as it would interfere with the iteration
 * process.
 * <br>
 * Note that {@link #clear()} does not modify the hash table size. Rather, a family of {@linkplain #trim() trimming methods} lets you control the size of the table; this is particularly useful if
 * you reuse instances of this class.
 * <br>
 * Iterators generated by this map will enumerate pairs in the same order in which they have been added to the map (addition of pairs whose key is already present in the set does not change the
 * iteration order). Note that this order has nothing in common with the natural order of the keys. The order is kept by means of a int-specialized list, {@link IntVLA}, and is modifiable with this
 * class' {@link #reorder(int...)} and {@link #shuffle(IRNG)} methods, among other tools. It may be preferable to avoid instantiating an Iterator object and instead
 * use a normal int-based for loop with {@link #getAt(int)} called in each iteration. Though this doesn't allow easy deletion of items during iteration, it may be the
 * fastest way to iterate through an OrderedMap.
 * <br>
 * This class implements the interface of a sorted map, so to allow easy access of the iteration order: for instance, you can get the first key in iteration order with {@code firstKey()} without
 * having to create an iterator; however, this class partially violates the {@link SortedMap} contract because all submap methods throw an exception and {@link #comparator()} returns always
 * <code>null</code>.
 * <br>
 * Additional methods, such as <code>getAndMoveToFirst()</code>, make it easy to use instances of this class as a cache (e.g., with LRU policy).
 * <br>
 * This class allows approximately constant-time lookup of keys or values by their index in the ordering, which can
 * allow some novel usage of the data structure. {@link OrderedSet} can be used like a list of unique elements, keeping
 * order like a list does but also allowing rapid checks for whether an item exists in the OrderedSet, and OrderedMap
 * can be used like that but with values associated as well (where OrderedSet uses contains(), OrderedMap uses
 * containsKey()). You can also set the key and value at a position with {@link #putAt(Object, Object, int)}, or alter
 * the key while keeping its value and index the same with {@link #alter(Object, Object)}. Reordering works here too,
 * both with completely random orders from {@link #shuffle(IRNG)} or with a previously-generated ordering from
 * {@link #reorder(int...)} (you can produce such an ordering for a given size and reuse it across multiple Ordered data
 * structures with {@link IRNG#randomOrdering(int)}). Note that putAt() and {@link #removeAt(int)} do not run in constant
 * time, and depending on the point of insertion/removal, they are likely to run in linear time (but also note that most
 * insertion-ordered Maps and Sets don't allow insertion or removal at anywhere but the beginning or end of the order).
 * <br>
 * You can pass a {@link CrossHash.IHasher} instance such as {@link CrossHash#generalHasher} as an extra parameter to
 * most of this class' constructors, which allows the OrderedMap to use arrays (usually primitive arrays) as keys. If
 * you expect only one type of array, you can use an instance like {@link CrossHash#intHasher} to hash int arrays, or
 * the aforementioned generalHasher to hash most kinds of arrays (it can't handle most multi-dimensional arrays well).
 * If you aren't using arrays as keys, you don't need to give an IHasher to the constructor and can ignore this feature
 * most of the time. However, the default IHasher this uses if none is specified performs a small but significant
 * "mixing" step to make the default generated hashCode() implementation many classes use into a higher-quality
 * random-like value. This isn't always optimal; if you plan to insert 1000 sequential Integer keys with some small
 * amount of random Integers after them, then the mixing actually increases the likelihood of a collision and takes time
 * to calculate. You could use a very simple IHasher in that case, relying on the fact that only Integers will be added:
 * <pre>
 * new CrossHash.IHasher() {
 *     public int hash(Object data) { return (int)data; }
 *     public boolean areEqual(Object left, Object right) { return Objects.equals(left, right); }
 * };
 * </pre>
 * This is just one example of a case where a custom IHasher can be useful for performance reasons; there are also cases
 * where an IHasher is needed to enforce hashing by identity or by value, which affect program logic. Note that the
 * given IHasher is likely to be sub-optimal for many situations with Integer keys, and you may want to try a few
 * different approaches if you know OrderedMap is a bottleneck in your application. If the IHasher is a performance
 * problem, it will be at its worst if the OrderedMap needs to resize, and thus rehash, many times; this won't happen if
 * the capacity is set correctly when the OrderedMap is created (with the capacity equal to or greater than the maximum
 * number of entries that will be added).
 * <br>
 * Thank you, Sebastiano Vigna, for making FastUtil available to the public with such high quality.
