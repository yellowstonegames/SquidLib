/**
 * A modification of Blackman and Vigna's xoroshiro128+ generator using two 32-bit ints of state instead of two 64-bit
 * longs and also incorporating a large-increment counter (Weyl sequence) that is added to the rotated xoroshiro output;
 * this is tied with {@link Lathe32RNG} for the fastest generator on GWT I have found that also passes the full 32TB
 * battery of PractRand's statistical tests. Starfish32RNG has 2D equidistribution while this only has 1D; this means
 * Starfish32RNG (and GWTRNG) can produce all pairs of ints or all longs (except for one) with equal likelihood, while
 * Oriole32RNG (and Lathe32RNG) produce some pairs more often than others. In statistical testing, xoroshiro always
 * fails some binary matrix rank tests, but smaller-state versions fail other tests as well. The changes Oriole makes
 * apply only to the output of xoroshiro, not its well-tested state transition for the "xoroshiro state" part of this
 * generator, and these changes eliminate all statistical failures on 32TB of tested data, avoiding the failures the
 * small-state variant of xoroshiro suffers on BinaryRank, BCFN, DC6, and FPF. It avoids multiplication, like xoroshiro
 * and much of the xorshift family of generators, and any arithmetic it performs is safe for GWT. Oriole takes advantage
 * of xoroshiro's flaws being mostly confined to its output's lower bits by rotating the output of xoroshiro (the weaker
 * 32-bit-state version) and adding a "Weyl sequence," essentially a large-increment counter that overflows and wraps
 * frequently, to the output. Although the upper bits of xoroshiro are not free of artifacts either, they are harder to
 * find issues with (see
 * <a href="http://www.pcg-random.org/posts/xoroshiro-fails-truncated.html">this article by PCG-Random's author</a> for
 * more detail). It is unclear if the changes made here would improve the larger-state version, but they probably would
 * help to some extent with at least the binary rank failures. The period is also improved by incorporating the Weyl
 * sequence, up to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF00000000 .
 * <br>
 * The name comes from the insectivorous orange songbird called an oriole, which as I have found from the one that
 * visits my backyard, reacts quickly and is always looking for bugs to remove. It also sounds like "xoro."
