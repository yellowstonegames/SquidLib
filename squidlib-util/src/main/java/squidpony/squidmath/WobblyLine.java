/**
 * A drunkard's-walk-like algorithm for line drawing "wobbly" paths.
 * The line() methods here use an IRNG (and will make their own if they don't take one as a parameter) to make a choice
 * between orthogonal directions to travel in. Because they can go around the target instead of straight to it, they
 * also need a width and height for the map so they don't wander over the edge. You can also pass a weight to one of the
 * line() methods, which affects how straight the wobbly path will be (1.0 being just about perfectly straight, 0.5
 * being very chaotic, and less than 0.5 being almost unrecognizable as a path).
 * <br>
 * Based on Michael Patraw's C code, used for cave carving in his map generator. http://mpatraw.github.io/libdrunkard/
 * Created by Tommy Ettinger on 1/10/2016.
