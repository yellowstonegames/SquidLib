/**
 * A low-quality but very fast RNG that has no apparent visual artifacts here; uses Mark Overton's CMR subcycle
 * generator type, but modified to be especially GWT-friendly. Even though it has no visual issues when rendered as
 * pixels, it still fails PractRand testing almost immediately. This is meant to be an answer to when people ask for
 * a bare-minimum generator that's still "good enough" for games. It has a period of 0xFFF43787 or 4294195079, which
 * can be exhausted in seconds if you only generate numbers in that time, but some seeds will be in a different
 * cycle with a much lower period. The likelihood of choosing one of these seeds is low, less than a fiftieth of one
 * percent, but it can happen. It cannot produce all possible ints in its longest cycle, and it can't produce even a
 * fraction of all possible ints in its smallest cycle. It implements RandomnessSource, but if you just want to copy
 * this class with no dependencies, then the class declaration can easily be changed to
 * {@code public class BasicRandom32 extends Random implements Serializable} without any other changes. Note, it does
 * extend java.util.Random for additional ease of integration, but doesn't use the slow {@code synchronized} keyword
 * that Random's implementations do.
