/**
 * This is a RandomnessSource in the PCG-Random family. It performs pseudo-
 * random modifications to the output based on the techniques from the
 * Permuted Congruential Generators created by M.E. O'Neill.
 * Specifically, this variant is:
 * RXS M XS -- random xorshift, mcg multiply, fixed xorshift
 *
 * The most statistically powerful generator, but all those steps
 * make it slower than some of the others.
 * <br>
 * Even though benchmarks on similar programs in C would lead you to
 * believe this should be somewhat faster than LightRNG, benchmarking
 * with JMH seems to show LightRNG being roughly 16% faster than
 * PermutedRNG, and both drastically faster than java.util.Random .
 * This generator was implemented incorrectly for a large part of its history,
 * but it seems correct now, though it may be a little slower.
 * @author Melissa E. O'Neill (Go HMC!)
 * @author Tommy Ettinger
 * @see PintRNG PintRNG is similar to this algorithm but uses only 32-bit math, where possible.
