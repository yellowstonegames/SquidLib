/**
 * A StatefulRandomness with one {@code long} state; calling {@link #nextLong()} will produce every {@code long} exactly
 * once before repeating. This has been backported from jdkgdxds, which got this from SquidSquad originally. It is
 * extremely similar to {@link LightRNG}, but uses a different mixing/unary-hash function -- where LightRNG uses a
 * variant on MurmurHash3's mixer called Variant 13, this uses Pelle Evensen's
 * <a href="https://mostlymangling.blogspot.com/2019/12/stronger-better-morer-moremur-better.html">Moremur mixer</a>,
 * which performs at the same (high) speed but has somewhat higher quality. This generator has a period of exactly 2 to
 * the 64. It is a rather fast generator, particularly on Java 8 and/or OpenJ9. It has passed 64TB of PractRand testing
 * with no anomalies. This is also a SkippingRandomness.
