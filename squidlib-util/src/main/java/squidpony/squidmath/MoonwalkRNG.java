/**
 * An IRNG implementation that allows the extra functionality of a StatefulRandomness and a SkippingRandomness, as well
 * as allowing reverse-lookup of the state that produced a long using the static {@link #inverseNextLong(long)} method,
 * and distance checks between two generated numbers with the static {@link #distance(long, long)} method. A task this
 * might be useful for could be simple obfuscation that is hard to undo unless you know the starting state, like this:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>take a sequence of numbers or characters and a MoonwalkRNG with a given starting state,</li>
 *     <li>modify each item in the sequence with a random but reversible change such as a bitwise XOR
 *     with a number produced by the MoonwalkRNG (such as by {@link #nextInt()}),</li>
 *     <li>on a later run, take the modified sequence and a MoonwalkRNG with the same starting state (but no direct
 *     access to the starting sequence), and skip ahead by the length of the sequence with {@link #skip(long)},</li>
 *     <li>starting at the end of the sequence, apply the reverse change to the items with numbers generated
 *     <b>backwards</b> by MoonwalkRNG with {@link #previousInt()} (such as a XOR if the number was originally modified
 *     with a XOR or an addition if it was originally modified with a subtraction),</li>
 *     <li>when the full sequence has been reversed, you now have the original sequence again./li>
 * </ol>
 * This is also possible with determine() methods in various RandomnessSource implementations, but those require some
 * extra work to allow them to use sequential inputs instead of inputs that have a large difference between generations.
 * <br>
 * Internally, this is like {@link StatefulRNG} if it always used {@link LightRNG} and allowed access to LightRNG's
 * skip() method as well as the reverse lookup and distance methods that aren't in LightRNG but are allowed by it.
 * <br>
 * The name comes from the ability of this generator to easily go in reverse, like the moonwalk dance move, including
 * {@link #previousLong()} and {@link #skip(long)} for advancing backwards, but also {@link #inverseNextLong(long)} to
 * go from output back to state.
