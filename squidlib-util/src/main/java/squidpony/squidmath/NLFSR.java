/**
 * A Non-Linear Feedback Shift Register that may be used like a StatefulRandomness but is not truly random. This is
 * based on the {@link LFSR} class, and is less predictable but is otherwise less than optimal in some ways. It has a
 * period of (2 to the 27) minus 1, and uses data from
 * http://people.kth.se/~dubrova/nlfsr.html and https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/314.pdf . You would normally only prefer
 * NLFSR over LFSR if you expect players to scrutinize your randomly-generated data, or if you want to use it as part of
 * a more complex process such as encoding a saved file in a more robust way.
 * It is important to note that an NLFSR or LFSR will produce each number from 1 until its maximum exactly once before
 * repeating, so this may be useful as a way of generating test data in an unpredictable order.
