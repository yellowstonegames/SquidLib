/**
 * A quasi-random number generator that goes through one of many sub-random sequences found by J.G. van der Corput.
 * More specifically, this offers both the normal van der Corput sequence, which only changes the state by incrementing
 * it (this works better in the normal usage as part of a 2D or 3D point generator) and a kind of scrambled van der
 * Corput sequence, where the state changes unpredictably (this works better when using this to generate 1D sequences,
 * or when the base may be larger than 7 or non-prime). In both cases, the state is internally stored in a 64-bit long
 * that is incremented once per generated number, but when scramble is true, the state is altered with something similar
 * to a Gray code before being used; more on this later if you want to read about it. The important things to know about
 * this class are: size of state affects speed (prefer smaller seeds, but quality is sometimes a bit poor at first if
 * you start at 0); the base (when given) should be prime (smaller bases tend to yield better quality, but oddly, larger
 * bases perform better); this doesn't generate very random numbers when scramble is false (which can be good
 * for making points that should not overlap), but it will seem much more random when scramble is true; this is a
 * StatefulRandomness with an additional method for generating quasi-random doubles, {@link #nextDouble()}; and there
 * are several static methods offered for convenient generation of points on the related Halton sequence (as well as
 * faster generation of doubles in the base-2 van der Corput sequence, and a special method that switches which base
 * it uses depending on the index to seem even less clearly-patterned).
 * <br>
 * This generator allows a base (also called a radix) that changes the sequence significantly; a base should be prime,
 * and this performs better in terms of time used with larger primes, though quality is also improved by preferring
 * primes that aren't very large relative to the quantity of numbers expected to be generated. Unfortunately,
 * performance is not especially similar to conventional PRNGs; smaller (positive) state values are processed more
 * quickly than larger ones, or most negative states. At least one 64-bit integer modulus and one 64-bit integer
 * division are required for any number to be produced, and the amount of both of these relatively-non-cheap operations
 * increases linearly with the number of digits (in the specified base, which is usually not 10) needed to represent
 * the current state. Since performance is not optimal, and the results are rather strange anyway relative to PRNGs,
 * this should not be used as a direct substitute for a typical RandomnessSource (however, it is similar to, but simpler
 * and faster than, {@link SobolQRNG}). So what's it good for?
 * <br>
 * A VanDerCorputSequence can be a nice building block for more complicated quasi-randomness, especially for points in
 * 2D or 3D, when scramble is false. There's a simple way that should almost always "just work" as the static method
 * {@link #halton(int, int, int, int[])} here. If it doesn't meet your needs, there's a little more complexity involved.
 * Using a VanDerCorputQRNG with base 3 for the x-axis and another VanDerCorputQRNG with base 5 for the y-axis,
 * requesting a double from each to make points between (0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0), has an interesting trait that can be
 * desirable for many kinds of positioning in 2D: once a point has been generated, an identical point will never be
 * generated until floating-point precision runs out, but more than that, nearby points will almost never be generated
 * for many generations, and most points will stay at a comfortable distance from each other if the bases are different
 * and both prime (or, more technically, if they share no common denominators). This is also known as a Halton sequence,
 * which is a group of sequences of points instead of simply numbers. The choices of 3 and 5 are examples; any two
 * different primes will technically work for 2D (as well as any two numbers that share no common factor other than 1,
 * that is, they are relatively coprime), but patterns can be noticeable with primes larger than about 7, with 11 and 13
 * sometimes acceptable. Three VanDerCorputQRNG sequences could be used for a Halton sequence of 3D
 * points, using three different prime bases, four for 4D, etc. SobolQRNG can be used for the same purpose, but the
 * points it generates are typically more closely-aligned to a specific pattern, the pattern is symmetrical between all
 * four quadrants of the square between (0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0) in 2D, and it probably extends into higher dimensions.
 * Using one of the possible Halton sequences gives some more flexibility in the kinds of random-like points produced.
 * Oddly, using a base-2 van der Corput sequence as the x axis in a Halton sequence and a base-39 van der Corput
 * sequence as the y axis results in the greatest minimum distance between points found so far while still involving a
 * base-2 sequence (which is preferential for performance). There, the minimum distance between the first 65536 points
 * in the [0,1) range is 0.001147395; a runner-up is a y base of 13, which has a minimum distance of 0.000871727 . The
 * (2,39) Halton sequence is used by {@link #halton(int, int, int)} and {@link #halton(int, int, int, int[])}.
 * <br>
 * Because just using the state in a simple incremental fashion puts some difficult requirements on the choice of base
 * and seed, we can scramble the long state {@code i} with code equivalent to
 * {@code (i ^ Long.rotateLeft(i, 7) ^ Long.rotateLeft(i, 17))}. This scramble is different from earlier versions and
 * unlike the earlier ones has a one-to-one mapping from input states to scrambled states.
 * <br>
 * Created by Tommy Ettinger on 11/18/2016. Uses code adapted from
 * <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2017/05/29/when-random-numbers-are-too-random-low-discrepancy-sequences/">Alan Wolfe's blog</a>,
 * which turned out to be a lot faster than the previous way I had it implemented.
