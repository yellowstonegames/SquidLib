/**
 * A group of similar methods for getting hashes of points based on long coordinates in 2, 3, 4, or 6 dimensions and
 * a long for state; like {@link PointHash} but faster and maybe not as high-quality. This implementation has
 * high enough quality to be useful as a source of random numbers based on positions, but would likely not be a good
 * option in a hash table (or at least not as good as the tailored implementation of {@link Coord#hashCode()}, for
 * instance). At low dimensions, this is a little faster than {@link PointHash}, but this class doesn't slow 
 * down much at all as more dimensions are used, while PointHash and most other implementations do slow down. You
 * can also consider {@link IntPointHash} if your input and output types are usually int, since it's even faster.
 * <br>
 * This implements {@link IPointHash} and has a long it uses internally for state, exposed by {@link #getState()}.
