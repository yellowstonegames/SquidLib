/**
 * A type of RNG that can generate values larger or smaller than the normal maximum or minimum, based on a modifier.
 * You should not use this as a general-purpose substitute for {@link RNG}; it is meant for cases where there is no hard
 * maximum or minimum for a random value, so it is a poor fit for getting random items from collections or shuffling.
 * It also uses a curved distribution (almost Gaussian, but slightly more shallow), which makes its results to be most
 * often near the center of the range they can fall into. The {@link #luck} field affects the distribution simply, and
 * should generally be between -0.5f and 0.5f except in cases where a character or event routinely defies all odds.
 * There is no value for luck that will prevent this from sometimes producing values outside the requested range, though
 * at luck = 0 it is somewhat rare for the bounds to be significantly exceeded.
 * <br>
 * The name comes from "critical hit," the rare but potentially very significant strike in many role-playing games.
