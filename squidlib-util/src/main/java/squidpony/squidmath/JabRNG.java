/**
 * A very fast and high-quality generator, but one that is not equidistributed because it produces 64-bit longs from 63
 * bits of state (meaning at least half of all possible long values cannot be returned by this generator). This still
 * passes gjrand with no failures on 100 GB of test data, and PractRand with 1TB (possibly more), while sometimes being
 * significantly faster than {@link ThrustAltRNG}. ThrustAltRNG passes PractRand at the normal limit of 32TB, but this
 * fails it at 2TB, so this class is expected to change if an improvement is found. The inlined version of
 * {@link #nextLong()} is the fastest generator in all of SquidLib, even counting deeply-flawed generators like
 * {@link LapRNG}. The name comes from its origin with Thrust, but as opposed to a full-body movement for a thrust in
 * fencing, this only "moves" some of its bits, like a jab in boxing.
 * <br>
 * The state is always odd here, and {@link #setState(long)} will always ensure that is maintained.
