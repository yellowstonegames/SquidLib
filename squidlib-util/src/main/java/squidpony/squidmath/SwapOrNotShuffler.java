/**
 * Gets a sequence of distinct pseudo-random ints (typically used as indices) from 0 to some bound, without storing all
 * of the sequence in memory. Uses a Swap-Or-Not network with 6 rounds using on a non-power-of-two domain, as described
 * in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1176">this paper by Viet Tung Hoang, Ben Morris, and Phillip Rogaway</a>.
 * The API is very simple; you construct a SwapOrNotShuffler by specifying how many items it can shuffle, and you can
 * optionally use a seed (it will be random if you don't specify a seed). Call {@link #next()} on a SwapOrNotShuffler
 * to get the next distinct int in the shuffled ordering; next() will return -1 if there are no more distinct ints (if
 * {@link #bound} items have already been returned). You can go back to the previous item with {@link #previous()},
 * which similarly returns -1 if it can't go earlier in the sequence. You can restart the sequence with
 * {@link #restart()} to use the same sequence over again, or {@link #restart(long)} to use a different seed (the bound
 * is fixed).
 * <br>
 * This class is extremely similar to {@link LowStorageShuffler}, but LowStorageShuffler is optimized for usage on GWT
 * while SwapOrNotShuffler is meant to have higher quality in general. There's also {@link ShuffledIntSequence}, which
 * extends LowStorageShuffler and uses different behavior so it "re-shuffles" the results when all results have been
 * produced, and {@link SNShuffledIntSequence}, which extends this class but is otherwise like ShuffledIntSequence.
