/**
 * Gets a sequence of distinct pseudo-random ints (typically used as indices) from 0 to some bound, without storing all
 * of the sequence in memory. Uses a Swap-Or-Not shuffle with 6 rounds on a non-power-of-two domain (0 inclusive to
 * bound exclusive), as described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1176">this paper by Viet Tung Hoang, Ben
 * Morris, and Phillip Rogaway</a>. The API is very simple; you construct a SwapOrNotShuffler by specifying how many
 * items it can shuffle, and you can optionally use a seed (it will be random if you don't specify a seed). Call
 * {@link #next()} on a SwapOrNotShuffler to get the next distinct int in the shuffled ordering; next() will return -1
 * if there are no more distinct ints (if {@link #bound} items have already been returned). You can go back to the
 * previous item with {@link #previous()}, which similarly returns -1 if it can't go earlier in the sequence. You can
 * restart the sequence with {@link #restart()} to use the same sequence over again, or {@link #restart(int)} to use a
 * different seed (the bound is fixed).
 * <br>
 * This class is extremely similar to {@link LowStorageShuffler}; both classes are optimized for usage on GWT but
 * SwapOrNotShuffler is meant to have higher quality in general. LowStorageShuffler sometimes performs better (when the
 * bound is equal to or just less than a power of 4), but often performs much worse (when the bound is just a little
 * more than a power of 4), while SwapOrNotShuffler has steady performance that has an expected-case near the best-case
 * of LowStorageShuffler. There's also {@link ShuffledIntSequence}, which extends LowStorageShuffler and uses different
 * behavior so it "re-shuffles" the results when all results have been produced, and {@link SNShuffledIntSequence},
 * which extends this class but is otherwise like ShuffledIntSequence.
 * <br>
 * Don't use this for cryptographic purposes; it uses too-few rounds, the "function" is probably as insecure as it gets,
 * and in this version there are only 2 to the 32 possible keys, which would make a brute-force attack trivial. It seems
 * good enough for generating shuffles for domains with unusual small sizes when the purpose is game-related, and not
 * anything too serious. While the Swap-or-Not Shuffle algorithm is capable of strong security guarantees, this
 * implementation emphasizes speed and does not offer any hope of security against a competent attacker.
