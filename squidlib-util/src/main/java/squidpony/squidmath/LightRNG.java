/**
 * This is a SplittableRandom-style generator, meant to have a tiny state
 * that permits storing many different generators with low overhead.
 * It should be rather fast, though no guarantees can be made on all hardware.
 * It should be faster than using SplittableRandom from Java 8 because it has a
 * single "gamma" value that prevents it from being split but also makes runtime
 * a bit quicker. It is based on using a unary hash on a large-increment counter,
 * which makes even the first item obtained from similarly-seeded LightRNGs very
 * likely to be very different. This is an advantage over non-hash-based RNGs.
 * <br>
 * This generator is especially fast on OpenJ9, version 0.17.0 or later (from
 * late 2019), and can be several times faster there than on HotSpot.
