/**
 * A RandomnessSource based on PCG-Random that has a single int of state. Its period is extremely short at 2 to the 32,
 * but its quality over that period is high even though its speed is not especially noteworthy. This generator is not
 * suitable for GWT; for that you should use {@link Starfish32RNG} or its wrapper {@link GWTRNG} if you need a
 * StatefulRandomness, {@link Lathe32RNG} if you want optimal speed and don't mind distribution flaws when producing
 * longs, or {@link Oriole32RNG} or {@link XoshiroStarPhi32RNG} if you need a higher period but don't need
 * StatefulRandomness' state adjustment methods.
 * <br>
 * Quality should be excellent in this version (at least for a generator with so little state) since it's based directly
 * on PCG-Random's choices of numerical constants. Visual tests, at least, appear indistinguishable from other PRNGs.
 * Period is very low, at 2 to the 32, but all seeds should be valid, including 0. Generating 64 bits of random data
 * takes a little less than twice as much time as generating 32 bits, since this can avoid some overhead via inlining.
 * <br>
 * The name can be construed as Pint-Size, since this has a small period and uses a smaller amount of space, or as
 * Permuted Int, since this is based on PermutedRNG, changed to use 32-bit operations on ints.
 * <br>
 * Based on work by Melissa E. O'Neill for PCG-Random; some code has been ported more-directly than other sections, but
 * the foundation for this class would not be possible without O'Neill's work.
