/**
 * A mid-quality StatefulRandomness based on {@link LinnormRNG} but modified to allow any odd number as a stream,
 * instead of LinnormRNG's hardcoded stream of 1; at least some streams fail statistical testing, but only after at
 * least 8TB of data is analyzed, failing at 16TB. Has 64 bits of state, 64 bits used to store a stream (which cannot be
 * changed after construction) and natively outputs 64 bits at a time. Changes its state with a basic linear
 * congruential generator (it is simply {@code state = state * 1103515245 + stream}). Starting with that LCG's
 * output, it xorshifts that output, multiplies by a very large negative long, then returns another xorshift. Like
 * LinnormRNG, the output of this simple function passes all 32TB of PractRand with no anomalies (at least for the
 * tested streams), meaning its statistical quality is excellent. The speed of this particular class isn't fully clear
 * yet, but benchmarks performed under the heavy load of PractRand testing happening at the same time appeared to show
 * no significant difference between LinnormRNG and MizuchiRNG in speed (which means it's tied for second place in its
 * category, behind {@link DiverRNG}). Since at least some streams fail before the 32TB goal, this class will probably
 * be changed to use a different algorithm, and as such is marked as Beta.
 * <br>
 * This generator is a StatefulRandomness but not a SkippingRandomness, so it can't (efficiently) have the skip() method
 * that LightRNG has. A method could be written to run the generator's state backwards, though, as well as to get the
 * state from an output of {@link #nextLong()}. {@link LinnormRNG} uses the same algorithm except for the number added
 * in the LCG state update; there this number is always 1, but here it can be any odd long. This means that any given
 * MizuchiRNG object has two long values stored in it instead of the one in a LinnormRNG, but it allows two MizuchiRNG
 * objects with different streams to produce different, probably-not-correlated sequences of results, even with the same
 * seed. This property may be useful for cases where an adversary is trying to predict results in some way, though using
 * different streams for this purpose isn't enough and should be coupled with truncation of a large part of output (see
 * PCG-Random's techniques for this).
 * <br>
 * The name comes from combining the concept of a linnorm, which is a dragon and the namesake of LinnormRNG, with
 * streams, since Mizuchi allows many possible streams, to get the concept of a river-or-stream-dwelling dragon. The
 * mizuchi is a (by some versions of the story) river dragon from Japanese mythology.
 * <br>
 * Written May 14, 2018 by Tommy Ettinger. Thanks to M.E. O'Neill for her insights into the family of generators both
 * this and her PCG-Random fall into, and to the team that worked on SplitMix64 for SplittableRandom in JDK 8. Chris
 * Doty-Humphrey's work on PractRand has been invaluable, and the LCG multiplier this uses is the same one used by
 * PractRand in its "varqual" LCGs (the other, longer multiplier is from PCG-Random, and that's both the
 * nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers used here). Thanks also to Sebastiano Vigna and David Blackwell for creating the
 * incredibly fast xoroshiro128+ generator and also very fast <a href="http://xoshiro.di.unimi.it/hwd.php">HWD tool</a>;
 * the former inspired me to make my code even faster and the latter tool seems useful so far in proving the quality of
 * the generator (LinnormRNG passes over 100TB of HWD, and probably would pass much more if I gave it more days to run).
