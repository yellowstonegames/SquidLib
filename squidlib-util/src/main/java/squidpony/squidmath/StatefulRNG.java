     * seed instead of all 64). The older behavior isn't fully preserved, since it used a rather low-quality String
     * hashing algorithm and so probably had problems producing good starting seeds, but you can get close by replacing
     * {@code new StatefulRNG(text)} with {@code new StatefulRNG(new LightRNG(CrossHash.hash(text)))}. The new technique
     * assigns to all 64 bits and has less correlation between similar inputs causing similar starting states. It's also
     * faster, but that shouldn't matter in a constructor. It uses a better hashing algorithm because CrossHash no
     * longer has the older, worse one. The latest change in June switched to LinnormRNG instead of LightRNG.
