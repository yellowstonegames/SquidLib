/**
 * A variant on {@link ThrustAltRNG} that gives up some speed, but allows choosing any of 2 to the 63 odd-number streams
 * that change the set of possible outputs this can produce (amending the main flaw of ThrustAltRNG). This does well in
 * PractRand quality tests, passing at least 8TB and probably more (it shares a lot of structure with ThrustAltRNG,
 * which does very well in PractRand's testing as well as TestU01's BigCrush). It also outperforms LinnormRNG and comes
 * close to ThrustAltRNG in JMH benchmarks, making it arguably the fastest random number generator algorithm here that
 * can produce all long values (it just needs multiple generator objects to do so, all seeded differently). If you
 * expect to have many individual RandomnessSources all seeded differently, this should be a good pick; if you only have
 * one RandomnessSource in use, you should prefer {@link DiverRNG} if you don't mind that it can't produce duplicates,
 * {@link OrbitRNG} if you want something similar to this generator that allows all state pairs, or {@link GWTRNG} if
 * you expect to use GWT to target HTML.
 * <br>
 * Because this can produce multiple occurrences of any number in its sequence (except 0, which it should always produce
 * once over its period of 2 to the 64), it can be considered as passing the "birthday problem" test; after running
 * <a href="http://www.pcg-random.org/posts/birthday-test.html">this test provided by Melissa E. O'Neill</a> on Tangle,
 * it correctly has 9 repeats compared to an expected 10, using the Skipping adapter to check one out of every 65536
 * outputs for duplicates. A generator that failed that test would have 0 repeats or more than 20, so Tangle passes.
 * ThrustAltRNG probably also passes (or its structure allows it to potentially do so), but LightRNG, LinnormRNG,
 * and many others will fail it by never repeating an output. Truncating the output bits of any of these
 * generators will allow them to pass this test, at the cost of reducing the size of the output to an int instead of a
 * long (less than ideal). Notably, an individual Tangle generator tends to be able to produce about 2/3 of all possible
 * long outputs, with roughly 1/3 of all outputs not possible to produce and another 1/3 produced exactly once. These
 * are approximations and will vary between instances. The test that gave the "roughly 2/3 possible" result gave similar
 * results with 8-bit stateA and stateB and with 16-bit stateA and stateB, though it could change with the 64-bit states
 * Tangle actually uses.
 * <br>
 * The name "Tangle" comes from how the two states of this generator are "tied up in each other," with synchronized
 * periods of 2 to the 64 (stateA) and 2 to the 63 (stateB) that repeat as a whole every 2 to the 64 outputs. Contrary
 * to the name, Tangle isn't slowed down at all by this, but the period length of the generator is less than the maximum
 * possible (which OrbitRNG has, though that one is slowed down).
 * <br>
 * See also {@link OrbitRNG}, which gives up more speed but moves through all 2 to the 64 long values as streams over
 * its full period, which is 2 to the 128 (with one stream) instead of the 2 to the 64 (with 2 to the 63 streams) here.
 * Orbit hasn't been evaluated for quality as fully as Tangle, but reduced-word-size variants show it should have a full
 * period of 2 to the 128.
