/**
 * A different approach to the same task {@link ProbabilityTable} solves, though this only looks up an appropriate index
 * instead of also storing items it can choose; allows positive doubles for weights but does not allow nested tables for
 * simplicity. This doesn't store an RNG (or RandomnessSource) in this class, and instead expects a long to be given for
 * each random draw from the table (these long parameters can be random, sequential, or in some other way different
 * every time). Uses <a href="http://www.keithschwarz.com/darts-dice-coins/">Vose's Alias Method</a>, and is based
 * fairly-closely on the code given by Keith Schwarz at that link. Because Vose's Alias Method is remarkably fast (O(1)
 * generation time in use, and O(n) time to construct a WeightedTable instance), this may be useful to consider if you
 * don't need all the features of ProbabilityTable or if you want deeper control over the random aspects of it.
 * <br>
 * Internally, this uses LinnormRNG's algorithm as found in {@link LinnormRNG#determineBounded(long, int)} and
 * {@link LinnormRNG#determine(long)} to generate two ints, one used for probability and treated as a 31-bit integer
 * and the other used to determine the chosen column, which is bounded to an arbitrary positive int. It does this with
 * just one randomized 64-bit value, allowing the state given to {@link #random(long)} to be just one long.
