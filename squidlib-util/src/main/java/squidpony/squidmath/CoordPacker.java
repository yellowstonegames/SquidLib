/**
 * Provides static methods to encode Coords as single primitive ints in various ways, hence the namesake, but also
 * provides advanced methods to encode 2D arrays of various sorts produced by SquidLib in extremely memory-efficient
 * representations, and decode those representations to various types of 2D array on-demand.
 *<br>
 * NOTE: This class is atypically complex and low-level for SquidLib because it is attempting to attain some very
 * challenging performance gains. You should not consider it idiomatic SquidLib code or start modifying it unless
 * you have a good grasp of bitwise operations and the performance implications, particularly in regard to memory
 * consumption, that higher-level and more convenient Java programming techniques have.
 *<br>
 * The pack() methods in this class take a 2D array with a clear division between cells in an "on" state and cells in an
 * "off" state, and they produce a very tightly compressed short array that can be losslessly decompressed with the
 * unpack() methods to a boolean 2D array that stores equivalent on/off data to the input. The packMulti() method in
 * this class takes a double 2D array that has more than two states that may need to be encoded, such as an FOV map that
 * stores light level as a value between 0.0 and 1.0 instead of just on or off, and an additional double array that
 * defines what states should be distinguished in the result (for example, if the FOV can store values that differ by
 * 0.1 for a FOV radius of 10, you could pass the array of 10 levels: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ... 0.9, 1.0). The value returned
 * by packMulti() is a short[][], but with different array lengths for each sub-array (a jagged array); the length of
 * the short[][] is the same as the length of the levels array, and each sub-array corresponds to a different level of
 * FOV lighting or other gradation as defined in levels. This short[][] can be passed to the unpackMultiByte() method in
 * this class to produce a byte 2D array where the original levels correspond to progressively greater bytes, with 0
 * used for cells that were less than the smallest value in levels, 1 for values that were only greater than the
 * smallest value, and no others, in levels, then 2 for larger values, etc. until it places a byte with a value equal to
 * the length of levels in the cells that are the highest. There is also the unpackMultiDouble() method in this class
 * that takes the same short[][] unpackMultiByte() can take, but also takes a levels double array that should be the
 * same as the one used to compress short[][]. It will return a double 2D array with any cells that were smaller than
 * the smallest value in levels assigned 0.0, and any other cells will be assigned a double that corresponds to the
 * highest value in levels that does not exceed the original double at that location in the unpacked data. To make this
 * more clear, if you have 4 levels: [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0] and you packMulti() on an FOV with a large radius and
 * sample values 0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 1.0, you will get a packed short[][] with 4 sub-arrays to match the 4 levels. If you
 * then pass the short[][] and levels to unpackMultiDouble later, much of the same radius will be filled, but because
 * the sample value 0.1 was less than the smallest value in levels, its cell will be given 0.0. What was originally 0.45
 * will be given the next-lower levels value, 0.25; 0.8 will be given 0.75, and 1.0 will remain 1.0.
 *<br>
 * This compression is meant to produce a short[] or short[][] that uses as little memory as possible for the specific
 * case of compressing maps with these qualities:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Maps are not especially large for a grid-based game; the maximum size is 256x256 cells.</li>
 *     <li>The vast majority of that 256x256 space is either unused or filled with cells no greater than 0.</li>
 *     <li>The cells that are greater than 0 are mostly near each other, though separate areas are possible.</li>
 * </ul>
 * These properties are all shared by typical roguelike FOV maps, and the specificity of these circumstances mean
 * extraordinarily dense compression can be achieved using the right combination of algorithms. In early testing,
 * using dungeon maps generated by {@link squidpony.squidgrid.mapping.DungeonGenerator} that should be typical of
 * roguelike maps and a diamond-shaped FOV with radius 8, compression of the short[] returned by pack() vs.
 * the original double[][] (which wastefully represents 2 states with 8 bytes) yields average memory usage ratios
 * between (with relatively optimal parameters) 0.0001237905030818498 in one of the best cases, and (with some very
 * poor parameters for the dungeon, but still using a realistic FOV map) 0.003135985198889917 in one of the worst.
 *<br>
 * This table shows the results for the average of 100 runs of pack() in a map with a "good size" and 100 runs in a map
 * with a "bad size." Both the compression ratio vs. a double[][] that stores only whether a cell is on or off and a
 * boolean[][] that stores the same information are provided.

 * In the best-case scenario of packing a 240x240 double array to a short array encoding two states, the result
 * uses less than 1/8000 the memory that the input uses. Writing to disk can store both input and output more
 * efficiently, but the method used here should ensure that even encoding the input FOV map as a flat sequence of
 * single bits and compressing the file should still be on par with the output of pack() due to optimization to
 * ensure nearby cells on a map are compressed together.
 *<br>
 * The technique used by this class is to walk along a Hilbert Curve, storing whether the walk is traveling through
 * "on" or "off" cells, which can be determined by a comparison to a number or a boolean, then encoding alternate shorts
 * into the short[] to be returned, with even-number indices (starting at 0) in the array corresponding to the number of
 * contiguous cells walked through in the "off" state, and odd-number indices corresponding to the number of
 * contiguous cells walked through in the "on" state. A user of this library does not need to understand the details
 * and properties of this algorithm unless they want to generate maps that will compress more optimally. In short:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Smaller maps tend to be processed faster by pack(), since the nature of a Hilbert Curve means a map that
 * fits in one half the width and one half the height of the curve only needs to walk one quarter of the Curve to
 * get all the needed information.</li>
 * <li>Smaller maps also compress less optimally ratio-wise than larger maps with the same area of "on" cells. The
 * compression ratio approaches its best when using very large maps, such as 240x240, and encoding just a few
 * cells on that map (such as for a small FOV radius or a cramped room). A map that is entirely "off" uses only 16
 * bytes of RAM (the minimum for any array on the JVM).</li>
 * <li>Unusually shaped maps can cause compression problems by forcing adjacent cells to sometimes require walking
 * more cells than needed to get to an adjacent cell. For example, a map greater than 64 cells tall, but less than
 * 33 cells wide, has properties that require walking through a large empty area to get to sometimes only a few
 * cells that are "on" before it walks back through empty space. Similarly, a map that is greater than 128 cells
 * tall but is otherwise narrow has the same property of requiring walking through empty space, but also requires
 * the entire Curve to be walked even if the map's width is only a tiny fraction of the Curve's 256 cells.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>In shorter-than-short</b>, you'll get particularly good results for compression speed and compressed size with
 * maps approximately these sizes: 240x240, 240x120, 120x120, 60x120, 60x60, 60x30, 30x30. The biggest maps have the
 * best relative gain on compressed memory usage, and the smallest maps have the best compression speed.
 *<br>
 * The details of the algorithm are not terribly complex once you understand the Hilbert Curve. The simplified
 * version of the Hilbert Curve that SquidLib employs is essentially a path through a square grid (it must have side
 * lengths that are powers of 2, and SquidLib always uses 256), starting in the corner cell (x=0,y=0), ending in the
 * corner cell (x=0,y=255), and traversing every other cell on the grid along its path without ever traveling in a
 * loop, crossing the path it walked, or moving in any direction but one cell up, down, left, or right. The shape
 * of the path this takes has the useful property of keeping most groups of cells walked through with similar x and
 * y at similar distances traveled from the start of the curve, and most groups of cells with very dissimilar x and
 * y at very different distances traveled. Since FOV and several other things you might want to encode with CoordPacker
 * tends to be clustered in small areas and occupy more complicated shapes than straight lines due to dungeon layout
 * blocking sections of FOV, the simplest paths of a wide zigzag from side-to-side, or an outward-going-in spiral, have
 * rather poor behavior when determining how much of an area they pass through contiguously. The contiguous area trait
 * is important because of the next step: Run-Length Encoding.
 *<br>
 * Run-Length Encoding is much simpler to explain than the Hilbert Curve, especially without visual aids. In the version
 * SquidLib uses, only on or off states need to be recorded, so the method used here is smaller and more efficient than
 * most methods that need to store repeated characters in strings (and letters, numbers, and punctuation clearly have
 * more than 2 states). The technique works like this:
 *<br>
 * Start in the "off" state, walk down the Hilbert Curve counting how many cells you walk through that are still "off,"
 * and when you encounter a cell that is "on," you write down how many cells were off, transition to the "on" state. Now
 * keep walking the Hilbert Curve, but counting how many cells you walk through that are still "on." When you reach
 * an "off" cell, write down how many were "on," then start walking and counting again, with your count starting at 0.
 * Repeat until you reach the end of the Hilbert Curve, but if you reach the end while counting "off" cells, you don't
 * need to write down that number (a shortcut allows many maps to stop sooner than the 65,536th element of the Curve).
 *<br>
 * There are some additional traits that relate to the edge of the map being treated as "off" even though no
 * calculations are done for cells out of map bounds, and some optimizations that ensure that maps that are smaller than
 * a half, a quarter, or an eighth of the 256x256 curve in both dimensions (and sometimes just one) only need to walk a
 * portion of the Hilbert Curve and simply skip the rest without walking it.
 *<br>
 * The Hilbert Curve has not been definitively proven to be the best possible path to ensure 1D distance and 2D location
 * are similar, but it has been extensively used for tasks that require similar locations for similar distances (in
 * particular, it has become useful in supercomputing clusters for allocating related work to physically nearby
 * machines), and since there hasn't been anything with better spatial properties discovered yet, this technique should
 * remain useful for some time.
