/**
 * Like LightRNG, but shares a lot in common with one of CrossHash's hashing algorithms. The name comes from its
 * similarity to that particular hash, Lightning, but also to how the current version acts like LightRNG,
 * sort-of, but involves a thunder-like "echo" where the earlier results are used as additional state for the
 * next result. Why should you consider it? It appears to be the fastest RandomnessSource we have available that still
 * has relatively strong quality, and is one of a few RNGs in the library that can generate 1 billion random long values
 * in under 1 second on an Intel i7-6700HQ laptop processor (LapRNG is faster than ThunderRNG at producing longs and
 * {@link FlapRNG} is faster than ThunderRNG at producing ints; behind ThunderRNG in the RandomnessSource race would
 * be a tie between {@link LightRNG} and {@link XoRoRNG} at roughly 1400 ms on the same laptop).
 * Any layer on top of generating long values slows this down, which is the case for most of the
 * RandomnessSource implementations, but ThunderRNG's {@link #nextInt()} method, which gets the most
 * significant 32 bits of a random long and returns them as an int, is a reliable and fast way to generate quality
 * int values. This does not implement {@link StatefulRandomness} because it stores state in two parts, each a long;
 * each is incremented by a different addend with each number generated. Part B is always odd, and is
 * incremented by a large, empirically-chosen number that is even; because odd + even = odd, always, part B
 * never becomes even. Part A is always incremented by an irregular selection of the bits in Part B, but the
 * selection never causes the increment to be by an even number (this also means it never increments by 0).
 * This irregular increment seems to increase ThunderRNG's period, but by how much is not clear.
 * <br>
 * The reason why nextInt() uses only the most significant half of the bits, even though it requires a shift in
 * addition to a cast, is because the period of the less significant bits is lower, though by how much isn't
 * clear. One early test used a 512x512 pixel window with a call to ThunderRNG's next() method for each pixel
 * (2 to the 18 calls per render), getting only two bits at time (yes, this is wasteful and a bad idea in
 * practice). Though the seed wasn't being reset each frame, the generated 2-bit values were effectively
 * identical between frames (adding one additional call to next() made the random sections move predictably
 * along one axis, one pixel at a time, which indicates they would be the same values every frame if the extra
 * call was removed). The early version that had this likely flaw always took the lowest bits, here the lowest
 * two bits, in next(), but changing next() to use the same number of bits from higher in the random long
 * eliminated this issue. Calls to nextLong() should still be expected to have a lower-than-normal period for
 * the low bits, with the bottom 2 bits likely having a period of 4096 or less. The period of the full 64
 * bits is unknown at this time, but is probably higher than 2 to the 64, and is almost certainly at least 2 to
 * the 63 (which is the probable period of Part B on its own, and because Part A changes every time by a
 * random-seeming, non-zero subset of Part B where the LSB is always set, the final result can't have a lower
 * period than Part B).
 * <br>
 * The tool used for testing this RNG is PractRand, http://pracrand.sourceforge.net/ . The binaries it provides
 * don't seem to work as intended on Windows, so I built from source, generated 64MB files of random 64-bit
 * output with various generators as "Thunder.dat", "Light.dat" and so on, then ran the executables I had
 * built with the MS compilers, with the command line {@code RNG_test.exe stdin64 < Thunder.dat} . For most of
 * the other generators I tried, there were no or nearly-no statistical failures it could find, and as of the (second)
 * commit on August 31, ThunderRNG also has no statistical failures or even anomalies. Earlier versions were
 * slightly faster (at best speed, 600-700ms) but had multiple outright failures (the fastest ones failed the
 * majority of tests). This best speed is matched today by {@link LapRNG}, but that is almost certain to have worse
 * statistical quality and period than ThunderRNG. If speed is what matters first, you should try LapRNG, since it is
 * about 25-35% faster than ThunderRNG.
