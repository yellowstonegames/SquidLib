/**
 * Similar to MimicFill, this class can be used to imitate the style of an existing piece of data, but this works on
 * more than just booleans; it can produce similar styles of texture (its original use in SynTex), of map, of item
 * placement, and so on by specifying a different technique for differentiating two int values.
 * <br>
 * Two options are now available; the process() method allows the slow analyze() step to be computed once,
 * before the rest of processing is potentially done many times, but the new neoProcess() method produces
 * comparable or better results and is drastically faster even without needing analysis. This means
 * neoProcess(), based on P.F. Harrison's algorithm in SynTex, is strongly recommended now.
 * <br>
 * Example results of neoProcess(), with a procedural dungeon first and the mimic versions after it:
 * https://gist.github.com/tommyettinger/405336fb0fc74838d806c021aabe77da (you may need to click Raw and zoom
 * out somewhat for it to render well).
