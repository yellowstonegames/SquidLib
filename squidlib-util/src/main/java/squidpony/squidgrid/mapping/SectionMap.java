/**
 * A Map-like collection that allows storing subdivisions of a 2D array with names (always Strings) and
 * identifying numbers, then looking up {@link Coord}s to find the associated name and/or number, or or looking up
 * a subdivision with a name or number to get a {@link GreasedRegion} back. This also stores connections between
 * sections, which can be useful as part of a graph-like algorithm. It is fed the information it needs by a
 * {@link RoomFinder} instance passed to the constructor or to {@link #reinitialize(RoomFinder)}. A RoomFinder is ready
 * for usage after generating any dungeon with {@link SectionDungeonGenerator} or one of its subclasses; the field
 * {@link SectionDungeonGenerator#finder} should usually be all that needs to be given to this class. If you don't use
 * SectionDungeonGenerator, there's no reason you can't construct a RoomFinder independently and pass that (they can
 * take a little time to construct on large or very complex maps, but shouldn't be heavy after construction).
 * <br>
 * If your code uses the {@link squidpony.squidgrid.zone.Zone} interface, then the {@link GreasedRegion} objects this
 * can return do implement Zone, {@link squidpony.squidgrid.zone.MutableZone}, and {@link Iterable} of Coord.
 * GreasedRegion is significantly faster than the alternatives ({@link squidpony.squidmath.CoordPacker} and manual
 * Lists of Coord) for the spatial manipulations that RoomFinder needs to do to find room-like shapes, and this just
 * gets its GreasedRegion values from RoomFinder directly.
 * <br>
 * Not to be confused with {@link squidpony.squidmath.RegionMap}, which has different functionality and a different
 * pupose; RegionMap simply is a slight extension on OrderedMap to conveniently handle regions as short arrays produced
 * by {@link squidpony.squidmath.CoordPacker}, while this class offers additional features for labeling and looking up
 * sections of a map that were found by a {@link RoomFinder}.
