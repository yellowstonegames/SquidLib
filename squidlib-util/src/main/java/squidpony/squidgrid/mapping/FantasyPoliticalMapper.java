/**
 * When you have a world map as produced by {@link WorldMapGenerator}, you may want to fill it with claims by various
 * factions, where each faction may be hand-made and may consist of humans or some fantasy species, such as goblins,
 * elves, or demons. This can assign contiguous areas of land to various factions, while acknowledging any preferences
 * some species may have for specific types of land (elves may strongly prefer forest terrain, or flying demons may be
 * the ideal residents for difficult mountainous terrain). This needs both a {@link WorldMapGenerator}, preferably
 * {@link squidpony.squidgrid.mapping.WorldMapGenerator.TilingMap} or
 * {@link squidpony.squidgrid.mapping.WorldMapGenerator.EllipticalMap} because they distribute area equally across the
 * map, and a {@link squidpony.squidgrid.mapping.WorldMapGenerator.BiomeMapper} to allocate biomes and height/moisture
 * info.
