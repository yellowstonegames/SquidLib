/**
 * When you have a world map as produced by {@link WorldMapGenerator} or some other source, you may want to fill it with
 * claims by various nations/factions, possibly procedural or possibly hand-made. This can assign contiguous areas of
 * land to various factions, while ignoring some amount of "wild" land if desired, and keeping oceans unclaimed.
 * The factions can be given procedural names in an atlas that is linked to the chars used by the world map.
 * Uses {@link MultiSpill} internally to produce the semi-random nation shapes. Stores an {@link #atlas} that can be
 * used to figure out what a char in a produced 2D char array means for its claiming nation, a {@link #briefAtlas} that
 * will have short, identifiable parts of generated names corresponding to the same chars as in atlas, and an OrderedMap
 * of {@link #spokenLanguages} that contains any randomly generated languages produced for nations.
