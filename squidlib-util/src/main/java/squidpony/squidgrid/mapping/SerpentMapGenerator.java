/**
 * Generate dungeons based on a random, winding, looping path through 2D space. Uses techniques from MixedGenerator.
 * Uses a Moore Curve, which is related to Hilbert Curves but loops back to its starting point, and stretches and
 * distorts the grid to make sure a visual correlation isn't obvious. This supports the getEnvironment() method, which
 * can be used in conjunction with RoomFinder to find where separate room, corridor, and cave areas have been placed.
 * <br>
 * To get a sense of what kinds of map this generates, you can look at a sample map on
 * https://gist.github.com/tommyettinger/93b47048fc8a209a9712 , which also includes a snippet of Java code that can
 * generate that map.
 * <br>
 * The name comes from a vivid dream I had about gigantic, multi-colored snakes that completely occupied a roguelike
 * dungeon. Shortly after, I made the connection to the Australian mythology I'd heard about the Rainbow Serpent, which
 * in some stories dug water-holes and was similarly gigantic.
 * Created by Tommy Ettinger on 10/24/2015.
