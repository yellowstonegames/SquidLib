/**
 * Helps handle formation of messages from a template, using correct pronouns and helping handle various idiosyncrasies
 * in English-language text. You call the static method
 * {@link #transform(CharSequence, String, NounTrait, String, NounTrait)} (or one of its overloads) with a template that
 * has specific placeholder glyphs, along with a user name, optional target name, user NounTrait (an enum in this class)
 * to specify how the user should be addressed, including their gender, optional target NounTrait, and possibly extra
 * terms that should be inserted. The placeholder glyphs are usually followed by a specific word that is conjugated in
 * the template for the first-person case, and will be changed to fit the NounTrait for the user or target. For example,
 * you could use "@Name hit$ ^ for ~ damage!" as a message. You could transform it with user "Heero Supra", userTrait
 * NounTrait.SECOND_PERSON_SINGULAR, target "the beast", targetTrait NounTrait.UNSPECIFIED_GENDER, and extra "10" to get
 * the message "You hit the beast for 10 damage!". You could swap the user and target (along with their traits) to get
 * the message "The beast hits you for 10 damage!" You can handle more complex verbs in some cases, such as "@I hurr$$$
 * to catch up!" can be transformed to "You hurry to catch up!" or "He hurries to catch up!". The rules are fairly
 * simple; @word conjugates a specific word from a list to the correct kind for the user, while ^word does a similar
 * thing but conjugates for the target. Between 1 and 3 $ chars can be used at the end of verbs to conjugate them
 * appropriately for the present tense when the verb is performed by the user (with just $) or alternately the target
 * (if the $ chars are preceded by a ^), while @s, @ss, @sss, ^s, ^ss, or ^sss can be added at the end of nouns to
 * pluralize them if appropriate. Using one $ or s will add s or nothing, as in the case of hit becoming hits, using two
 * $ or s chars will add es or nothing, as in the case of scratch becoming scratches, and using three will add ies or y,
 * as in the case of carry becoming carries. Some unusual pluralization forms are handled; @usi will turn octop@usi into
 * octopus or octopi, and radi@usi into radius or radii, while @fves will turn el@fves into elf or elves, or dwar@fves
 * into dwarf or dwarves.
 * <br>
 * The words you can put after a @ or ^ start with a small list and can be added to with
 * {@link #learnIrregularWord(String, String, String, String, String, String, String)}. The initial list is: name,
 * name_s, i, me, my, mine, myself, am, have, do, haven_t, don_t, or any of these with the first char capitalized (meant
 * for words at the start of sentences). The non-word shortened terms "m" and "ve" can be used for "I'm" and "I've",
 * respectively, as well as "you're" and "you've", plus "he's" for "he is" and "he's" for "he has". Most of the rest
 * conjugate as you would expect; @me will become him, her, it, them, you, or still more forms depending on userTrait.
 * You can also use @ or ^ on its own as an equivalent to @name or ^name.
 * <br>
 * Examples:
 * <br>
 * {@code Messaging.transform("@I @am @my own boss@ss.", "unused", changingTrait)}
 * <ul>
 *     <li>When changingTrait is {@code NounTrait.FIRST_PERSON_SINGULAR}, this returns "I am my own boss."</li>
 *     <li>When changingTrait is {@code NounTrait.FIRST_PERSON_PLURAL}, this returns "We are our own bosses."</li>
 *     <li>When changingTrait is {@code NounTrait.SECOND_PERSON_SINGULAR}, this returns "You are your own boss."</li>
 *     <li>When changingTrait is {@code NounTrait.SECOND_PERSON_PLURAL}, this returns "You are your own bosses."</li>
 *     <li>When changingTrait is {@code NounTrait.NO_GENDER}, this returns "It is its own boss."</li>
 *     <li>When changingTrait is {@code NounTrait.MALE_GENDER}, this returns "He is his own boss."</li>
 *     <li>When changingTrait is {@code NounTrait.FEMALE_GENDER}, this returns "She is her own boss."</li>
 *     <li>When changingTrait is {@code NounTrait.UNSPECIFIED_GENDER}, this returns "They are their own boss."</li>
 *     <li>When changingTrait is {@code NounTrait.ADDITIONAL_GENDER}, this returns "Xe is xis own boss."</li>
 *     <li>When changingTrait is {@code NounTrait.SPECIAL_CASE_GENDER}, this returns "Qvqe is qvqis own boss."</li>
 *     <li>When changingTrait is {@code NounTrait.GROUP}, this returns "They are their own bosses."</li>
 * </ul>
 * {@code Messaging.transform("@Name spit$ in ^name_s face^s!", userName, userTrait, targetName, targetTrait)}
 * <ul>
 *     <li>When userTrait is {@code NounTrait.SECOND_PERSON_SINGULAR}, targetName is {@code "the goblin"}, and
 *     targetTrait is {@code NounTrait.MALE_GENDER}, this returns "You spit in the goblin's face!"</li>
 *     <li>When userName is {@code "the goblin"}, userTrait is {@code NounTrait.MALE_GENDER}, and targetTrait is
 *     {@code NounTrait.SECOND_PERSON_SINGULAR}, this returns "The goblin spits in your face!"</li>
 *     <li>When userTrait is {@code NounTrait.SECOND_PERSON_SINGULAR}, targetName is {@code "the goblins"}, and
 *     targetTrait is {@code NounTrait.GROUP}, this returns "You spit in the goblins' faces!"</li>

    /**
     * Properties of nouns needed to correctly conjugate those nouns and refer to them with pronouns, such as genders.
     * Includes parts of speech, which only are concerned with whether they refer to a singular noun or a plural noun,
     * and genders for when a gendered pronoun is needed. This provides substantial support for uncommon cases regarding
     * gender and pronoun preferences. That said, gender and pronoun preference can be incredibly hard to handle.
     * The simplest cases are for first- and second-person pronouns; here we have "I/me/my/myself" for
     * {@link #FIRST_PERSON_SINGULAR}, "you/you/your/yourself" for {@link #SECOND_PERSON_SINGULAR},
     * "we/us/our/ourselves" for {@link #FIRST_PERSON_PLURAL}, and "you/you/your/yourselves" for
     * {@link #SECOND_PERSON_PLURAL}; there are more pronouns this can produce, but they aren't listed here.
     * Third-person pronouns are considerably more challenging because English sporadically considers gender as part of
     * conjugation, but doesn't provide a universally-acceptable set of gendered pronouns.
     * <br>
     * This at least tries to provide pronoun handling for the common cases, such as "you" not needing a gendered
     * pronoun at all (it uses {@link #SECOND_PERSON_SINGULAR}), and supports {@link #MALE_GENDER male},
     * {@link #FEMALE_GENDER female}, {@link #NO_GENDER genderless} (using "it" and related forms; preferred especially
     * for things that aren't alive, and in most cases not recommended for people),
     * {@link #UNSPECIFIED_GENDER "unspecified"} (using "they" in place of "he" or "she"; preferred in some cases when
     * describing someone with a non-specific gender or an unknown gender) pronouns, and {@link #GROUP group} for when a
     * group of individuals, regardless of gender or genders, is referred to with a single pronoun. As mentioned, this
     * has support for some uncommon situations, like {@link #ADDITIONAL_GENDER additional gender} (as in, a gender that
     * is in addition to male and female but that is not genderless, which has a clear use case when describing
     * non-human species, and a more delicate use for humans who use non-binary gender pronouns; hopefully "xe" will be
     * acceptable), and finally a {@link #SPECIAL_CASE_GENDER "special case"} pronoun that is unpronounceable and, if
     * given special processing, can be used as a replacement target for customized pronouns. For the additional gender,
     * the non-binary gendered pronouns are modified from the male pronouns by replacing 'h' with 'x' (he becomes xe,
     * his becomes xis). The "special case" pronouns replace the 'h' in the male pronouns with 'qvq', except for in one
     * case. Where, if the female pronoun were used, it would be "hers", but the male pronoun in that case would be "his",
     * changing the male pronoun would lead to a difficult-to-replace case because "his" is also used in the case where
     * the female pronoun is the usefully distinct "her". Here, the "special case" gender diverges from what it usually
     * does, and uses "qvqims" in place of "his" or "hers". The "special case" pronouns should be replaced before being
     * displayed, since they look like gibberish or a glitch and so are probably confusing out of context.
