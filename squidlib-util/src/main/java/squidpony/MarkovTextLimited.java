/**
 * A simple Markov chain text generator; it is called "Limited" because it only can be used as an order-1 Markov chain,
 * meaning only one prior word is looked at. To use, call {@link #analyze(CharSequence)} once on a large sample text,
 * then you can call {@link #chain(long)} many times to get odd-sounding "remixes" of the sample text. For more natural
 * output, you can use {@link MarkovText}, which is an order-2 Markov chain and so looks at two previous words. This is
 * meant to allow easy serialization of the necessary data to call chain(); if you can store the {@link #words} and
 * {@link #processed} arrays in some serialized form, then you can reassign them to the same fields to avoid calling
 * analyze(). One way to do this conveniently is to use {@link #serializeToString()} after calling analyze() once and to
 * save the resulting String; then, rather than calling analyze() again on future runs, you would call
 * {@link #deserializeFromString(String)} to create the MarkovTextLimited without needing any repeated analysis.
