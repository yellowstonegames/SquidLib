/**
 * An alternative to AStarSearch when you want to fully explore a search space, or when you want a gradient floodfill.
 * It's currently significantly faster that AStarSearch, and also supports pathfinding to the nearest of multiple
 * goals, which is not possible with AStarSearch. This last feature enables a whole host of others, like pathfinding
 * for creatures that can attack targets between a specified minimum and maximum distance, and there's also the
 * standard uses of Dijkstra Maps such as finding ideal paths to run away. One unique optimization made possible by
 * Dijkstra Maps is for when only one endpoint of a path can change in some section of a game, such as when you want to
 * draw a path from the player's current cell to the cell the mouse is over, and while the mouse can move quickly, the
 * player doesn't move until instructed to. This can be done very efficiently by setting the player as a goal with
 * {@link #setGoal(Coord)}, scanning the map to find distances with {@link #scan(Collection)}, and then as long as the
 * player's position is unchanged (and no obstacles are added/moved), you can get the path by calling
 * {@link #findPathPreScanned(Coord)} and giving it the mouse position as a Coord. If various parts of the path can
 * change instead of just one (such as other NPCs moving around), then you should set a goal or goals and call
 * {@link #findPath(int, Collection, Collection, Coord, Coord...)}. The parameters for this are used in various methods
 * in this class with only slight differences: length is the length of path that can be moved "in one go," so 1 for most
 * roguelikes and more for most strategy games, impassable used for enemies and solid moving obstacles, onlyPassable can
 * be null in most roguelikes but in strategy games should contain ally positions that can be moved through as long as
 * no one stops in them, start is the NPC's starting position, and targets is an array or vararg of Coord that the NPC
 * should pathfind toward (it could be just one Coord, with or without explicitly putting it in an array, or it could be
 * more and the NPC will pick the closest).
 * <br>
 * As a bit of introduction, the article http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Dijkstra_Maps_Visualized can
 * provide some useful information on how these work and how to visualize the information they can produce, while
 * http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Power_of_Dijkstra_Maps is an inspiring list of the
 * various features Dijkstra Maps can enable.
 * <br>
 * If you can't remember how to spell this, just remember: Does It Just Know Stuff? That's Really Awesome!

     * Scans the dungeon using DijkstraMap.scan with the listed goals and start point, and returns a list
     * of Coord positions (using the current measurement) needed to get closer to a goal, where goals are
     * considered valid if they are at a valid range for the given Technique to hit at least one target
     * and ideal if that Technique can affect as many targets as possible from a cell that can be moved
     * to with at most movelength steps.
     * <br>
     * The return value of this method is the path to get to a location to attack, but on its own it
     * does not tell the user how to perform the attack.  It does set the targetMap 2D Coord array field
     * so that if your position at the end of the returned path is non-null in targetMap, it will be
     * a Coord that can be used as a target position for Technique.apply() . If your position at the end
     * of the returned path is null, then an ideal attack position was not reachable by the path.
     * <br>
     * This needs a char[][] dungeon as an argument because DijkstraMap does not always have a char[][]
     * version of the map available to it, and certain AOE implementations that a Technique uses may
     * need a char[][] specifically to determine what they affect.
     * <br>
     * The maximum length of the returned list is given by moveLength; if moving the full length of
     * the list would place the mover in a position shared by one of the positions in allies
     * (which is typically filled with friendly units that can be passed through in multi-tile-
     * movement scenarios, and is also used considered an undesirable thing to affect for the Technique),
     * it will recalculate a move so that it does not pass into that cell.
     * <br>
     * The keys in impassable should be the positions of enemies and obstacles that cannot be moved
     * through, and will be ignored if there is a target overlapping one.
     * <br>
     * This overload takes a buffer parameter, an ArrayList of Coord, that the results will be appended to. If the
     * buffer is null, a new ArrayList will be made and appended to. This caches its result in a member field, path,
     * which can be fetched after finding a path and will change with each call to a pathfinding method. Any existing
     * contents of buffer will not affect the path field of this DijkstraMap.
     *
     * @param buffer     an existing ArrayList of Coord that will have the result appended to it (in-place); if null, this will make a new ArrayList
     * @param moveLength the maximum distance to try to pathfind out to; if a spot to use a Technique can be found
     *                   while moving no more than this distance, then the targetMap field in this object will have a
     *                   target Coord that is ideal for the given Technique at the x, y indices corresponding to the
     *                   last Coord in the returned path.
     * @param tech       a Technique that we will try to find an ideal place to use, and/or a path toward that place.
     * @param dungeon    a char 2D array with '#' for walls.
     * @param los        a squidgrid.LOS object if the preferred range should try to stay in line of sight, or null if LoS
     *                   should be disregarded.
