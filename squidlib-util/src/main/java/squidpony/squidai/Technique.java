/**
 * A simple struct-like class that stores various public fields which describe the targeting properties of a skill,
 * spell, tech, or any other game-specific term for a targeted (typically offensive) ability we call a Technique.
 * <br>
 * The typical usage of a Technique is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Construct any AOE implementation the Technique would use (if the Technique affects multiple grid cells).</li>
 * <li>Construct the Technique (passing the AOE as a parameter if needed).</li>
 * <li>Call {@link #setMap(char[][])} before considering the Technique if it has not been called yet, if the physical
 * map (including doors and obstacles) has changed since setMap() was last called, or simply on every Technique every
 * time the map changes if there are few enemies with few Techniques. PERFORMING ANY SUBSEQUENT STEPS WITHOUT SETTING
 * THE MAP TO THE CURRENT ACTUAL PHYSICAL MAP WILL HAVE BAD CONSEQUENCES FOR LOGIC AND MAY CAUSE CRASHING BUGS DUE TO
 * ARRAY BOUNDS VIOLATIONS IF YOU HAVEN'T SET THE MAP ARRAY IN THE FIRST PLACE. The map should be bounded by wall chars
 * ('#'), which is done automatically by {@link squidpony.squidgrid.mapping.DungeonGenerator} and similar classes, and
 * can be done with {@link squidpony.squidgrid.mapping.DungeonUtility#wallWrap(char[][])} as well.</li>
 * <li>When the Technique is being considered by an AI, call {@link #idealLocations(Coord, Set, Set, Set)} with the
 * values of targets, lesserTargets, and/or priorityTargets set to beings that the AI can see (likely using FOV) and
 * wants to affect with this Technique (enemies for offensive Techniques, allies for supporting ones), and
 * requiredExclusions typically set to allies for offensive Techniques that can cause friendly-fire damage, or to null
 * for supporting ones or Techniques that don't affect allies.</li>
 * <li>If the Technique is being used for a player action, you can show the player what cells are valid targets with
 * {@link #possibleTargets(Coord)} or its other overload, or can validate choices without telling the player beforehand
 * using {@link #canTarget(Coord, Coord)} (this may be useful for cases where the player is activating an unknown magic
 * item like a scroll, and the actual range hasn't been revealed).</li>
 * <li>When an ideal location has been determined from the previous step, and the player or AI decides to use this
 * Technique on a specific target point, call {@link #apply(Coord, Coord)} with the user position as a Coord and the
 * chosen Coord, and proceed to process the effects of the Technique as fitting for your game on the returned Map of
 * Coord keys to Double values denoting how affected (from 0.0 for unaffected to 1.0 for full power) that Coord is.
 * An AI might decide which Technique to use by an aggression ("aggro" or "hatred") level tracked per-enemy, by weights
 * on Techniques for different situations, by choosing at random, or some combination of factors.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * A Technique always has an AOE implementation that it uses to determine which cells it actually affects, and
 * Techniques that do not actually affect an area use the default single-cell "Area of Effect" implementation, PointAOE.
 * You typically will need to construct the implementing class of the AOE interface in a different way for each
 * implementation; BeamAOE, LineAOE, and ConeAOE depend on the user's position, BurstAOE and BlastAOE treat radii
 * differently from BeamAOE and LineAOE, and CloudAOE has a random component that can be given a seed.
 * <br>
 * A Technique has a String  name, which typically should be in a form that can be presented to a user, and a
 * String id, which defaults to the same value as name but can be given some value not meant for users that records
 * any additional identifying characteristics the game needs for things like comparisons.
