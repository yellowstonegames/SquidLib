 * This implements the random number function from the "Random Number" XKCD comic, with minor compatibility changes.
 * https://xkcd.com/221/ See explanation here: https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/221:_Random_Number
 * The period of this generator is optimal for its state size. Its state size is 0 bits. Thus, its period is 1.
 * <br>
 * Perhaps this is a good time to point out that none of our RandomnessSource implementations are truly random, but some
 * may be closer to random than others... or further from it.
 * <br>
 * Primarily useful for benchmarking, when you want to test the absolute minimum work a RandomnessSource can do as a
 * control group in a larger benchmark.
