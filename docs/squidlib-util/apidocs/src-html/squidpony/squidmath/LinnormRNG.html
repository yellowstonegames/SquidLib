<span class="source-line-no">008</span><span id="line.8"> * A mid-high-quality StatefulRandomness that is the second-fastest 64-bit generator in this library that is</span>
<span class="source-line-no">009</span><span id="line.9"> * 1-dimensionally equidistributed across its 64-bit outputs. Has a period of 2 to the 64, and permits all states.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">010</span><span id="line.10"> * Passes all statistical tests in PractRand up to 32TB of data. {@link DiverRNG} is a variant that is a little faster,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">011</span><span id="line.11"> * while keeping the same other qualities, so it is currently recommended over LinnormRNG (however, the same structure</span>
<span class="source-line-no">012</span><span id="line.12"> * is shared between LinnormRNG and {@link MizuchiRNG}, and Mizuchi has some extra features that Diver lacks). Has 64</span>
<span class="source-line-no">013</span><span id="line.13"> * bits of state and natively outputs 64 bits at a time, changing the state with a basic linear congruential generator</span>
<span class="source-line-no">014</span><span id="line.14"> * (it is simply {@code state = state * 3935559000370003845L + 1L}, with the large multiplier found by L'Ecuyer in a</span>
<span class="source-line-no">015</span><span id="line.15"> * 1999 paper). Starting with that LCG's output, it xorshifts that output twice (using</span>
<span class="source-line-no">016</span><span id="line.16"> * {@code z ^= (z &gt;&gt;&gt; 23) ^ (z &gt;&gt;&gt; 47);}), multiplies by a very large negative long, then returns another xorshift.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">017</span><span id="line.17"> * Considering that some seeds don't have any anomalies in 8TB with Linnorm, the quality is probably fine except for the</span>
<span class="source-line-no">018</span><span id="line.18"> * known potential issue that it can't return duplicate outputs until its period has cycled.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">019</span><span id="line.19"> * {@link ThrustAltRNG} and {@link MiniMover64RNG} are faster (tied for first place), but unlike those, Linnorm can</span>
<span class="source-line-no">020</span><span id="line.20"> * produce all long values as output; ThrustAltRNG bunches some outputs and makes producing them more likely while</span>
<span class="source-line-no">021</span><span id="line.21"> * others can't be produced at all, while MiniMover64RNG cycles at some point before 2 to the 64 but after 2 to the 42</span>
<span class="source-line-no">022</span><span id="line.22"> * (it doesn't produce any duplicates until then, but it also can't produce all values). Notably, this generator is</span>
<span class="source-line-no">023</span><span id="line.23"> * faster than {@link LightRNG} with similar quality, and also faster than {@link XoRoRNG} while passing tests that</span>
<span class="source-line-no">024</span><span id="line.24"> * XoRoRNG always or frequently fails (and fails early), such as binary matrix rank tests. It is slower than</span>
<span class="source-line-no">025</span><span id="line.25"> * {@link DiverRNG}, which is a variant on the structure of LinnormRNG.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">026</span><span id="line.26"> * &lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="source-line-no">027</span><span id="line.27"> * This generator is a StatefulRandomness but not a SkippingRandomness, so it can't (efficiently) have the skip() method</span>
<span class="source-line-no">028</span><span id="line.28"> * that LightRNG has. A method could be written to run the generator's state backwards, though, as well as to get the</span>
<span class="source-line-no">029</span><span id="line.29"> * state from an output of {@link #nextLong()}. {@link MizuchiRNG} uses the same algorithm except for the number added</span>
<span class="source-line-no">030</span><span id="line.30"> * in the LCG state update; here this number is always 1, but in MizuchiRNG it can be any odd long. This means that any</span>
<span class="source-line-no">031</span><span id="line.31"> * given MizuchiRNG object has two long values stored in it instead of the one here, but it allows two MizuchiRNG</span>
<span class="source-line-no">032</span><span id="line.32"> * objects with different streams to produce different, probably-not-correlated sequences of results, even with the same</span>
<span class="source-line-no">033</span><span id="line.33"> * seed. This property may be useful for cases where an adversary is trying to predict results in some way, though using</span>
<span class="source-line-no">034</span><span id="line.34"> * different streams for this purpose isn't enough and should be coupled with truncation of a large part of output (see</span>
<span class="source-line-no">035</span><span id="line.35"> * PCG-Random's techniques for this).</span>
<span class="source-line-no">036</span><span id="line.36"> * &lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="source-line-no">037</span><span id="line.37"> * The name comes from LINear congruential generator this uses to change it state, while the rest is a NORMal</span>
