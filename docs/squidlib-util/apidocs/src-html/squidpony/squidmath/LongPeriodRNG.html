<span class="source-line-no">012</span><span id="line.12"> * generate massive amounts of random numbers, more than pow(2, 64) (18,446,744,073,709,551,616), without repeating</span>
<span class="source-line-no">013</span><span id="line.13"> * the sequence of generated numbers. An RNG's period refers to the number of numbers it generates given a single</span>
<span class="source-line-no">014</span><span id="line.14"> * seed before the sequence repeats from the beginning. The period of this class is pow(2, 1024) minus 1</span>

<span class="source-line-no">019</span><span id="line.19"> * always some application that seems to need more; if you really need more than that, look into CMWC generators, which</span>
<span class="source-line-no">020</span><span id="line.20"> * can have even larger state and also even larger periods. There isn't one of those in SquidLib currently, though there</span>
<span class="source-line-no">021</span><span id="line.21"> * is a possibility of one being added in the future. There is a 64-bit MersenneTwister, which has an even larger period</span>
<span class="source-line-no">022</span><span id="line.22"> * than this one, but it might not have optimal quality for some applications (notably, the game Dungeon Crawl Stone</span>
<span class="source-line-no">023</span><span id="line.23"> * Soup used Mersenne Twister and found that some players in a competition could predict impending random events,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">024</span><span id="line.24"> * despite the generator seeming bulletproof).</span>
<span class="source-line-no">025</span><span id="line.25"> * &lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="source-line-no">026</span><span id="line.26"> * This class may be particularly useful in conjunction with the shuffle method of RNG; the period of an RNG determines</span>
<span class="source-line-no">027</span><span id="line.27"> * how many possible "shuffles", a.k.a orderings or permutations, can be produced over all calls to a permuting method</span>
<span class="source-line-no">028</span><span id="line.28"> * like shuffle. A LightRNG-backed RNG with a period of pow(2, 64) will only be able to produce all possible "shuffles"</span>
<span class="source-line-no">029</span><span id="line.29"> * for lists or arrays of 20 items or less. If a LongPeriodRNG is given to the constructor of an RNG and a large enough</span>
<span class="source-line-no">030</span><span id="line.30"> * state has been given to the LongPeriodRNG (the String or long[] constructors can allow this), then lists or arrays of</span>
<span class="source-line-no">031</span><span id="line.31"> * up to 170 elements can have all possible orderings produced by shuffle(), though it will take near-impossibly-many</span>
<span class="source-line-no">032</span><span id="line.32"> * calls. This class has 128 bytes of state plus more in overhead (compare to the 16-byte-with-overhead LightRNG), but</span>
<span class="source-line-no">033</span><span id="line.33"> * due to its massive period and createMany() static method, you can create a large number of subsequences with rather</span>
<span class="source-line-no">034</span><span id="line.34"> * long periods themselves from a single seed. This uses the xorshift-1024*phi algorithm, and has competitive speed.</span>

<span class="source-line-no">036</span><span id="line.36"> * This generator was updated to the "phi" variant of XorShift1024* instead of the "M_8" variant when the phi variant</span>
<span class="source-line-no">037</span><span id="line.37"> * became recommended over the version this originally used. The multiplier, and thus the sequence of numbers this</span>
