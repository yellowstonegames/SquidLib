<span class="source-line-no">008</span><span id="line.8"> * A quasi-random number generator that goes through one of many sub-random sequences found by J.G. van der Corput.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">009</span><span id="line.9"> * More specifically, this offers the standard family of van der Corput sequences, each defined by a (almost always</span>
<span class="source-line-no">010</span><span id="line.10"> * prime) base number. Each sequence only changes the state by incrementing it (this works better in the normal usage as</span>
<span class="source-line-no">011</span><span id="line.11"> * part of a 2D or 3D point generator). The state is internally stored in a 64-bit long that is incremented once per</span>
<span class="source-line-no">012</span><span id="line.12"> * generated number. The important things to know about this class are: size of state affects speed (prefer smaller</span>
<span class="source-line-no">013</span><span id="line.13"> * seeds, but quality is sometimes a bit poor at first if you start at 0); the base (when given) should be prime</span>
<span class="source-line-no">014</span><span id="line.14"> * (smaller bases tend to yield better quality, but oddly, larger bases perform better); this doesn't generate very</span>
<span class="source-line-no">015</span><span id="line.15"> * random numbers, and is classified as a quasi-random number generator (which can be good for making points that</span>
<span class="source-line-no">016</span><span id="line.16"> * should not overlap); this is a StatefulRandomness with an additional method for generating quasi-random doubles,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">017</span><span id="line.17"> * {@link #nextDouble()}; and there are several static methods offered for convenient generation of points on the</span>
<span class="source-line-no">018</span><span id="line.18"> * related Halton sequence (as well as faster generation of doubles in the base-2 van der Corput sequence, and a special</span>
<span class="source-line-no">019</span><span id="line.19"> * method that switches which base it uses depending on the index to seem even less clearly-patterned). There are also,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">020</span><span id="line.20"> * for lack of a better place to put such small code, methods to generate points in the R2 sequence found by Martin</span>
<span class="source-line-no">021</span><span id="line.21"> * Roberts, which is very similar in 2D to some Halton sequences but has better separation between points.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">022</span><span id="line.22"> * &lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="source-line-no">023</span><span id="line.23"> * This generator allows a base (also called a radix) that changes the sequence significantly; a base should be prime,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">024</span><span id="line.24"> * and this performs better in terms of time used with larger primes, though quality is also improved by preferring</span>
<span class="source-line-no">025</span><span id="line.25"> * primes that aren't very large relative to the quantity of numbers expected to be generated. Unfortunately,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">026</span><span id="line.26"> * performance is not especially similar to conventional PRNGs; smaller (positive) state values are processed more</span>
<span class="source-line-no">027</span><span id="line.27"> * quickly than larger ones, or most negative states. At least one 64-bit integer modulus and one 64-bit integer</span>
<span class="source-line-no">028</span><span id="line.28"> * division are required for any number to be produced, and the amount of both of these relatively-non-cheap operations</span>
<span class="source-line-no">029</span><span id="line.29"> * increases linearly with the number of digits (in the specified base, which is usually not 10) needed to represent</span>
<span class="source-line-no">030</span><span id="line.30"> * the current state. Since performance is not optimal, and the results are rather strange anyway relative to PRNGs,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">031</span><span id="line.31"> * this should not be used as a direct substitute for a typical RandomnessSource (however, it is similar to, but simpler</span>
<span class="source-line-no">032</span><span id="line.32"> * and faster than, {@link SobolQRNG}). So what's it good for?</span>
<span class="source-line-no">033</span><span id="line.33"> * &lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="source-line-no">034</span><span id="line.34"> * A VanDerCorputSequence can be a nice building block for more complicated quasi-randomness, especially for points in</span>
<span class="source-line-no">035</span><span id="line.35"> * 2D or 3D. There's a simple way that should almost always "just work" as the static method</span>
<span class="source-line-no">036</span><span id="line.36"> * {@link #halton(int, int, int, int[])} here. If it doesn't meet your needs, there's a little more complexity involved.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">037</span><span id="line.37"> * Using a VanDerCorputQRNG with base 3 for the x-axis and another VanDerCorputQRNG with base 5 for the y-axis,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">038</span><span id="line.38"> * requesting a double from each to make points between (0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0), has an interesting trait that can be</span>
<span class="source-line-no">039</span><span id="line.39"> * desirable for many kinds of positioning in 2D: once a point has been generated, an identical point will never be</span>
<span class="source-line-no">040</span><span id="line.40"> * generated until floating-point precision runs out, but more than that, nearby points will almost never be generated</span>
<span class="source-line-no">041</span><span id="line.41"> * for many generations, and most points will stay at a comfortable distance from each other if the bases are different</span>
<span class="source-line-no">042</span><span id="line.42"> * and both prime (or, more technically, if they share no common denominators). This is also known as a Halton sequence,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">043</span><span id="line.43"> * which is a group of sequences of points instead of simply numbers. The choices of 3 and 5 are examples; any two</span>
<span class="source-line-no">044</span><span id="line.44"> * different primes will technically work for 2D (as well as any two numbers that share no common factor other than 1,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">045</span><span id="line.45"> * that is, they are relatively coprime), but patterns can be noticeable with primes larger than about 7, with 11 and 13</span>
<span class="source-line-no">046</span><span id="line.46"> * sometimes acceptable. Three VanDerCorputQRNG sequences could be used for a Halton sequence of 3D</span>
<span class="source-line-no">047</span><span id="line.47"> * points, using three different prime bases, four for 4D, etc. SobolQRNG can be used for the same purpose, but the</span>
<span class="source-line-no">048</span><span id="line.48"> * points it generates are typically more closely-aligned to a specific pattern, the pattern is symmetrical between all</span>
<span class="source-line-no">049</span><span id="line.49"> * four quadrants of the square between (0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0) in 2D, and it probably extends into higher dimensions.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">050</span><span id="line.50"> * Using one of the possible Halton sequences gives some more flexibility in the kinds of random-like points produced.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">051</span><span id="line.51"> * Oddly, using a base-2 van der Corput sequence as the x axis in a Halton sequence and a base-39 van der Corput</span>
<span class="source-line-no">052</span><span id="line.52"> * sequence as the y axis results in the greatest minimum distance between points found so far while still involving a</span>
<span class="source-line-no">053</span><span id="line.53"> * base-2 sequence (which is preferential for performance). There, the minimum distance between the first 65536 points</span>
<span class="source-line-no">054</span><span id="line.54"> * in the [0,1) range is 0.001147395; a runner-up is a y base of 13, which has a minimum distance of 0.000871727 . The</span>
<span class="source-line-no">055</span><span id="line.55"> * (2,39) Halton sequence is used by {@link #halton(int, int, int)} and {@link #halton(int, int, int, int[])}.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">056</span><span id="line.56"> * &lt;br&gt;</span>
