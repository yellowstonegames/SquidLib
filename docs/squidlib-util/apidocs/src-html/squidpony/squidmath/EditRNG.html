<span class="sourceLineNo">006</span><a id="line.6"> * A subclass of StatefulRNG (and thus RNG) that allows customizing many parts of the random number generation.</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">007</span><a id="line.7"> * This is meant to be a more comprehensible version of the functionality present in RandomBias, and also for it to be</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">008</span><a id="line.8"> * easier to use with methods that expect an RNG.</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">009</span><a id="line.9"> * &lt;br&gt;</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">010</span><a id="line.10"> * You can change the expected average for the values this produces, which uses the RandomBias.EXPONENTIAL distribution,</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">011</span><a id="line.11"> * with all the caveats it has: it strongly favors either high or low values when the average gets especially high or</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">012</span><a id="line.12"> * low, but it can essentially cover all averages between 0.0 and 1.0 (this class limits it to 0.1 and 0.9, so other</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">013</span><a id="line.13"> * techniques can be used effectively).</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">014</span><a id="line.14"> * &lt;br&gt;</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">015</span><a id="line.15"> * You can also affect the "centrality" of random numbers, causing more to occur near the expected average (a bell curve</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">016</span><a id="line.16"> * effect), or cause more near extreme ends of the random number spectrum. In practice, centrality changes are hard to</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">017</span><a id="line.17"> * notice, but may be useful to simulate certain effects. An example of centrality changes in existing games include the</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">018</span><a id="line.18"> * Nintendo title Advance Wars 2, where a brutish commander could increase the amount of damage his units dealt but also</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">019</span><a id="line.19"> * suffered unpredictability; attacks could deal even more or much less damage than normal without any way to build</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">020</span><a id="line.20"> * tactics around it. Square Enix's Final Fantasy XII also notably differentiated certain weapons (axes, hammers, and</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">021</span><a id="line.21"> * "hand-cannons") from other similar options by making them deal less predictable damage. In both cases the connotation</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">022</span><a id="line.22"> * is that more randomness is fitting for a brute-force approach to combat where pre-planned strategies are less</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">023</span><a id="line.23"> * emphasized. It should also be noted that increasing the frequency of extreme results makes small bonuses to defense</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">024</span><a id="line.24"> * or offense typically less useful, and small penalties less harmful. The opposite can be true for a carefully tuned</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">025</span><a id="line.25"> * game where the most common results are tightly clustered, and most target numbers are just slightly above the</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">026</span><a id="line.26"> * ordinary average. In tabletop games, 1d20 and 3d6 have the same average, but 1d20 is uniform, where 3d6 is clustered</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">027</span><a id="line.27"> * around 10 and 11, each the result of 1/8 of rolls on their own and 1/4 together. This makes the case where a +1 bonus</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">028</span><a id="line.28"> * to succeed changes the outcome on approximately 5% of 1d20 rolls, regardless of the required number to succeed if it</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">029</span><a id="line.29"> * is less than 20. However, a +1 bonus matters on a variable portion of 3d6 rolls; if you become able to succeed on a</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">030</span><a id="line.30"> * 10 or 11 where that was a failure before, the bonus applies approximately 12.5% of the time. Becoming able to succeed</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">031</span><a id="line.31"> * on an 18 where that was a failure before is essentially worthless, affecting less than 0.5% of rolls. This property</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">032</span><a id="line.32"> * of centralized results should be considered if game balance and/or the lethality of combat is important. One lengthy</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">033</span><a id="line.33"> * stretch of extreme results by enemies that work against the favor of a player character generally result in a dead</a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">034</span><a id="line.34"> * player character, and RNGs that make extreme results more common may seem particularly cruel to players.</a>
