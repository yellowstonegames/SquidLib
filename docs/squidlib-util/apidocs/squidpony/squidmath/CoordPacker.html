<div class="block">Provides static methods to encode Coords as single primitive ints in various ways, hence the namesake, but also
 provides advanced methods to encode 2D arrays of various sorts produced by SquidLib in extremely memory-efficient
 representations, and decode those representations to various types of 2D array on-demand. IMPORTANT: you must call
 <a href="#init()"><code>init()</code></a> before using this class if you do not already use a SquidLib class that does so. It is a good habit
 to call init() in your main() method or primary game entry point if you use CoordPacker. Failure to call init() will
 not result in exceptions, but will make results inaccurate.

 There's a detailed introduction
 <a href="https://github.com/SquidPony/SquidLib/wiki/Handling-Map-Regions-with-CoordPacker">on the SquidLib wiki</a>,
 which is probably the best way to learn the techniques possible with this class. Most methods in this aren't useful
 on their own, but can be mixed and matched to get specific regions from a map, such as all floors not adjacent to a
 wall, or all grass within 3 squares of deep or shallow water, with walls blocking the distance measurement. You can
 also use packed data that this class produces as keys for <a href="RegionMap.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>RegionMap</code></a> to associate values with regions.
 <br>
 NOTE: Internally, this class is atypically complex and low-level for SquidLib because it is attempting to attain some
 very challenging performance gains. You should not consider it idiomatic SquidLib code or start modifying it unless
 you have a good grasp of bitwise operations and the performance implications, particularly in regard to memory
 consumption, that higher-level and more convenient Java programming techniques have.
 <br>
 NOTE 2: This class fills a role that is very similar to <a href="GreasedRegion.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>GreasedRegion</code></a>, and there are times when code will do
 better using CoordPacker than GreasedRegion and vice versa. GreasedRegion uses objects and tries to change them
 in-place whenever possible instead of allocating new data; CoordPacker uses short[] values that it never changes
 in-place and frequently allocates new short[] values to represent data. GreasedRegion stores the full map without any
 compression beyond "one bit per cell" and always needs to store all cells on the map (sometimes slightly more);
 CoordPacker can compress some data to significantly less than one bit per cell, and doesn't care about the maximum
 bounds of the map as long as it fits inside a 256x256 square. GreasedRegion is significantly faster than CoordPacker
 when performing any operations that move, shrink, or expand an area, such as <a href="#expand(short%5B%5D,int,int,int)"><code>expand(short[], int, int, int)</code></a>,
 <a href="#retract(short%5B%5D,int,int,int)"><code>retract(short[], int, int, int)</code></a>, and <a href="#translate(short%5B%5D,int,int,int,int)"><code>translate(short[], int, int, int, int)</code></a>. CoordPacker usually
 (not always) uses somewhat less memory than GreasedRegion, though both use very little unless the maps are very
 large or very numerous. Both can do essentially the same things, except that GreasedRegion has no equivalent to the
 <a href="#packMulti(byte%5B%5D%5B%5D,int)"><code>packMulti(byte[][], int)</code></a> and other Multi kinds of method, no <a href="#radiate(short%5B%5D,short%5B%5D,int)"><code>radiate(short[], short[], int)</code></a>, and no
 <a href="#reachable(short%5B%5D,short%5B%5D,squidpony.squidai.Reach)"><code>reachable(short[], short[], Reach)</code></a>, while CoordPacker has no equivalent to
 <a href="GreasedRegion.html#expandSeriesToLimit()"><code>GreasedRegion.expandSeriesToLimit()</code></a> and other ToLimit kinds of method, no
 <a href="GreasedRegion.html#toggle(int,int)"><code>GreasedRegion.toggle(int, int)</code></a>, no <a href="GreasedRegion.html#deteriorate(squidpony.squidmath.RandomnessSource,int)"><code>GreasedRegion.deteriorate(RandomnessSource, int)</code></a>, no
 <a href="GreasedRegion.html#insert(int,int,squidpony.squidmath.GreasedRegion)"><code>GreasedRegion.insert(int, int, GreasedRegion)</code></a> (though CoordPacker can generally use
 <a href="#unionPacked(short%5B%5D,short%5B%5D)"><code>unionPacked(short[], short[])</code></a> for that), and several other methods don't have equivalents. In general, you
 will probably find GreasedRegion more intuitive because it involves working with objects instead of a short[] that is
 treated like a particular kind of data, and the methods are also somewhat more clearly-named. GreasedRegion also
 implements Collection of Coord, while the short[] data can't implement anything. A way around this for CoordPacker is
 the <a href="../squidgrid/zone/CoordPackerZone.html" title="class in squidpony.squidgrid.zone"><code>CoordPackerZone</code></a> class; both that and GreasedRegion implement the
 <a href="../squidgrid/zone/Zone.html" title="interface in squidpony.squidgrid.zone"><code>Zone</code></a> interface, which ensures a way to get a List of Coord from the Zone.
 <br>
 The pack() methods in this class take a 2D array with a clear division between cells in an "on" state and cells in an
 "off" state, and they produce a very tightly compressed short array that can be losslessly decompressed with the
 unpack() methods to a boolean 2D array that stores equivalent on/off data to the input. The packMulti() method in
 this class takes a double 2D array that has more than two states that may need to be encoded, such as an FOV map that
 stores light level as a value between 0.0 and 1.0 instead of just on or off, and an additional double array that
 defines what states should be distinguished in the result (for example, if the FOV can store values that differ by
 0.1 for a FOV radius of 10, you could pass the array of 10 levels: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ... 0.9, 1.0). The value returned
 by packMulti() is a short[][], but with different array lengths for each sub-array (a jagged array); the length of
 the short[][] is the same as the length of the levels array, and each sub-array corresponds to a different level of
 FOV lighting or other gradation as defined in levels. This short[][] can be passed to the unpackMultiByte() method in
 this class to produce a byte 2D array where the original levels correspond to progressively greater bytes, with 0
 used for cells that were less than the smallest value in levels, 1 for values that were only greater than the
 smallest value, and no others, in levels, then 2 for larger values, etc. until it places a byte with a value equal to
 the length of levels in the cells that are the highest. There is also the unpackMultiDouble() method in this class
 that takes the same short[][] unpackMultiByte() can take, but also takes a levels double array that should be the
 same as the one used to compress short[][]. It will return a double 2D array with any cells that were smaller than
 the smallest value in levels assigned 0.0, and any other cells will be assigned a double that corresponds to the
 highest value in levels that does not exceed the original double at that location in the unpacked data. To make this
 more clear, if you have 4 levels: [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0] and you packMulti() on an FOV with a large radius and
 sample values 0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 1.0, you will get a packed short[][] with 4 sub-arrays to match the 4 levels. If you
 then pass the short[][] and levels to unpackMultiDouble later, much of the same radius will be filled, but because
 the sample value 0.1 was less than the smallest value in levels, its cell will be given 0.0. What was originally 0.45
 will be given the next-lower levels value, 0.25; 0.8 will be given 0.75, and 1.0 will remain 1.0.
 <br>
 This compression is meant to produce a short[] or short[][] that uses as little memory as possible for the specific
 case of compressing maps with these qualities:
 <ul>
     <li>Maps are not especially large for a grid-based game; the maximum size is 256x256 cells.</li>
     <li>The vast majority of that 256x256 space is either unused or filled with cells no greater than 0.</li>
     <li>The cells that are greater than 0 are mostly near each other, though separate areas are possible.</li>
 </ul>
 These properties are all shared by typical roguelike FOV maps, and the specificity of these circumstances mean
 extraordinarily dense compression can be achieved using the right combination of algorithms. In early testing,
 using dungeon maps generated by <a href="../squidgrid/mapping/DungeonGenerator.html" title="class in squidpony.squidgrid.mapping"><code>DungeonGenerator</code></a> that should be typical of
 roguelike maps and a diamond-shaped FOV with radius 8, compression of the short[] returned by pack() vs.
 the original double[][] (which wastefully represents 2 states with 8 bytes) yields average memory usage ratios
 between (with relatively optimal parameters) 0.0001237905030818498 in one of the best cases, and (with some very
 poor parameters for the dungeon, but still using a realistic FOV map) 0.003135985198889917 in one of the worst.
 <br>
 This table shows the results for the average of 100 runs of pack() in a map with a "good size" and 100 runs in a map
 with a "bad size." Both the compression ratio vs. a double[][] that stores only whether a cell is on or off and a
 boolean[][] that stores the same information are provided.

 In the best-case scenario of packing a 240x240 double array to a short array encoding two states, the result
 uses less than 1/8000 the memory that the input uses. Writing to disk can store both input and output more
 efficiently, but the method used here should ensure that even encoding the input FOV map as a flat sequence of
 single bits and compressing the file should still be on par with the output of pack() due to optimization to
 ensure nearby cells on a map are compressed together.
 <br>
 The technique used by this class is to walk along a Hilbert Curve, storing whether the walk is traveling through
 "on" or "off" cells, which can be determined by a comparison to a number or a boolean, then encoding alternate shorts
 into the short[] to be returned, with even-number indices (starting at 0) in the array corresponding to the number of
 contiguous cells walked through in the "off" state, and odd-number indices corresponding to the number of
 contiguous cells walked through in the "on" state. A user of this library does not need to understand the details
 and properties of this algorithm unless they want to generate maps that will compress more optimally. In short:
 <ul>
 <li>Smaller maps tend to be processed faster by pack(), since the nature of a Hilbert Curve means a map that
 fits in one half the width and one half the height of the curve only needs to walk one quarter of the Curve to
 get all the needed information.</li>
 <li>Smaller maps also compress less optimally ratio-wise than larger maps with the same area of "on" cells. The
 compression ratio approaches its best when using very large maps, such as 240x240, and encoding just a few
 cells on that map (such as for a small FOV radius or a cramped room). A map that is entirely "off" uses only 16
 bytes of RAM (the minimum for any array on the JVM).</li>
 <li>Unusually shaped maps can cause compression problems by forcing adjacent cells to sometimes require walking
 more cells than needed to get to an adjacent cell. For example, a map greater than 64 cells tall, but less than
 33 cells wide, has properties that require walking through a large empty area to get to sometimes only a few
 cells that are "on" before it walks back through empty space. Similarly, a map that is greater than 128 cells
 tall but is otherwise narrow has the same property of requiring walking through empty space, but also requires
 the entire Curve to be walked even if the map's width is only a tiny fraction of the Curve's 256 cells.</li>
 </ul>
 <b>In shorter-than-short</b>, you'll get particularly good results for compression speed and compressed size with
 maps approximately these sizes: 240x240, 240x120, 120x120, 60x120, 60x60, 60x30, 30x30. The biggest maps have the
 best relative gain on compressed memory usage, and the smallest maps have the best compression speed.
<br>
 The details of the algorithm are not terribly complex once you understand the Hilbert Curve. The simplified
 version of the Hilbert Curve that SquidLib employs is essentially a path through a square grid (it must have side
 lengths that are powers of 2, and SquidLib always uses 256), starting in the corner cell (x=0,y=0), ending in the
 corner cell (x=0,y=255), and traversing every other cell on the grid along its path without ever traveling in a
 loop, crossing the path it walked, or moving in any direction but one cell up, down, left, or right. The shape
 of the path this takes has the useful property of keeping most groups of cells walked through with similar x and
 y at similar distances traveled from the start of the curve, and most groups of cells with very dissimilar x and
 y at very different distances traveled. Since FOV and several other things you might want to encode with CoordPacker
 tends to be clustered in small areas and occupy more complicated shapes than straight lines due to dungeon layout
 blocking sections of FOV, the simplest paths of a wide zigzag from side-to-side, or an outward-going-in spiral, have
 rather poor behavior when determining how much of an area they pass through contiguously. The contiguous area trait
 is important because of the next step: Run-Length Encoding.
<br>
 Run-Length Encoding is much simpler to explain than the Hilbert Curve, especially without visual aids. In the version
 SquidLib uses, only on or off states need to be recorded, so the method used here is smaller and more efficient than
 most methods that need to store repeated characters in strings (and letters, numbers, and punctuation clearly have
 more than 2 states). The technique works like this:
<br>
 Start in the "off" state, walk down the Hilbert Curve counting how many cells you walk through that are still "off,"
 and when you encounter a cell that is "on," you write down how many cells were off, transition to the "on" state. Now
 keep walking the Hilbert Curve, but counting how many cells you walk through that are still "on." When you reach
 an "off" cell, write down how many were "on," then start walking and counting again, with your count starting at 0.
 Repeat until you reach the end of the Hilbert Curve, but if you reach the end while counting "off" cells, you don't
 need to write down that number (a shortcut allows many maps to stop sooner than the 65,536th element of the Curve).
<br>
 There are some additional traits that relate to the edge of the map being treated as "off" even though no
 calculations are done for cells out of map bounds, and some optimizations that ensure that maps that are smaller than
 a half, a quarter, or an eighth of the 256x256 curve in both dimensions (and sometimes just one) only need to walk a
 portion of the Hilbert Curve and simply skip the rest without walking it.
<br>
 The Hilbert Curve has not been definitively proven to be the best possible path to ensure 1D distance and 2D location
 are similar, but it has been extensively used for tasks that require similar locations for similar distances (in
 particular, it has become useful in supercomputing clusters for allocating related work to physically nearby
 machines), and since there hasn't been anything with better spatial properties discovered yet, this technique should
 remain useful for some time.

<div class="block">Given a number of total levels to consider separate in a double[][] such as an FOV result, this produces a levels
 array that can be passed to packMulti() to ensure that you have the requested number of separate levels in the
 multi-packed result. For example, if you pass 6 to this method, it will return a length-6 double array, and if
 you pass that as the levels parameter to packMulti(), then that method will return a length-6 array of short
 arrays that each encode a region that met a different minimum value in the originally packed double[][].
 The behavior of this method causes any doubles that are closer to 1.0 / totalLevels than they are to 0.0 to be
 packed as "on" in at least one of packMulti()'s resultant sub-arrays. This allows Radius.CIRCLE or similar FOV
 that produces cells with values that aren't evenly distributed between 0.0 and 1.0 to be used without causing an
 explosion in the number of required levels.

<div class="block">Given a number of total levels to consider separate in a double[][] such as an FOV result, this produces a levels
 array that can be passed to unpackMultiDouble() to ensure that the minimum double returned for an "on" cell is
 1.0 / totalLevels, and every progressively tighter level in the short[][] being unpacked will be close to a
 multiple of that minimum double value. This only applies to "on" cells; any cells that did not meet a minimum
 value when packed will still be 0.0. For example, if you pass 6 to this method, it will return a length-6 double
 array, and if you pass that as the levels parameter to unpackMultiDouble(), then that method will return a
 double[][] with no more than totalLevels + 1 used values, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 with evenly spaced values, all
 multiples of 1.0 / totalLevels, in between.
 <br>
 <b>This method should not be used to generate levels for packing; it is only intended for unpacking.</b> Use the
 similar method generatePackingLevels() to generate a levels array that is suitable for packing double[][] values.</div>

<div class="block">Compresses a double[][] (typically one generated by <a href="../squidgrid/FOV.html" title="class in squidpony.squidgrid"><code>FOV</code></a>) that stores any number of
 states and a double[] storing up to 63 states, ordered from lowest to highest, returning a short[][] as described
 in the <a href="CoordPacker.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>CoordPacker</code></a> class documentation. This short[][] can be passed to CoordPacker.unpackMultiDouble()
 to restore the state at a position to the nearest state in levels, rounded down, and return a double[][] that
 should preserve the states as closely as intended for most purposes. <b>For compressing FOV, you should generate
 levels with CoordPacker.generatePackingLevels()</b> instead of manually creating the array, because some
 imprecision is inherent in floating point math and comparisons are often incorrect between FOV with multiple
 levels and exact levels generated as simply as possible. generatePackingLevels() adds a small correction to the
 levels to compensate for floating-point math issues, which shouldn't affect the correctness of the results for
 FOV radii under 100.
<br>
 As stated in the class documentation, the compressed result is intended to use as little memory as possible for
 most roguelike FOV maps.
<br>
 <b>To store only two states</b>, you should use pack(), unless the double[][] divides data into on and off based
 on a relationship to some number other than 0.0. To (probably poorly) pack all the walls (and any cells with
 values higher than DijkstraMap.WALL) in a DijkstraMap's 2D array of doubles called dijkstraArray, you could call
 <code>packMulti(dijkstraArray, new double[]{DijkstraMap.WALL});</code>
 Then, you would use only the one sub-element of the returned short[][].</div>

               an FOV map that has multiple grades of brightness would be counted by this) and ascending until the
               last value; the last value should be highest (commonly 1.0 for FOV), and will be used for any cells

<div class="block">Gets the nth position that is "on" in the given packed array, without unpacking it, and returns it as a Coord.
 Uses Hilbert Curve ordering for the exact Hilbert Curve CoordPacker uses, so any two given Coords will always
 have the same before-after relationship. Returns null if n is not between 0 (inclusive) and the count of packed
 (exclusive), as by <code>CoordPacker.count()</code>.

 You can technically use nth to iterate over only the Coords that are defined in some packed data, but it's
 drastically more efficient to store a Coord array once with allPacked(). Using nth() as an iterator is
 essentially running a growing portion of what allPacked() does, over and over again, until the last Coord encoded
 in packed takes almost as long to process as one call to allPacked(). That said, for a single Coord this can be
 significantly faster than getting an array with allPacked() and fetching only one item from it.</div>

 with wide, expansive areas. If you want to make the regular pattern this uses impossible to discern, you can use
 <code>randomSeparated()</code> to keep distance between Coords and sample most areas of some packed data. Values for
 fraction that are multiples of 4 are likely to show a pattern in large open spaces more easily.</div>

 been set in reach to any value other than null or AimLimit.FREE; in these cases it requires an exactly straight
 orthogonal or diagonal line without obstructions, checking only cells along the precise path. For diagonals and
 eight-way targeting, this means it can target through walls that only meet at a perpendicular diagonal, such as
 an X shape where one line is a one-cell-thick diagonal wall and the other is the targeting line. This is normally
 only allowed in some games and only if they use Chebyshev (Radius.SQUARE) distance, so be advised that it may not
 be desirable behavior.

<div class="block">Given one packed short array, this produces a packed short array that is the exact opposite of the one passed in,
 that is, every "on" cell becomes "off" and every "off" cell becomes "on", including cells that were "off" because
 they were beyond the boundaries of the original 2D array passed to pack() or a similar method. This method does
 not do any unpacking (which can be somewhat computationally expensive), and actually requires among the lowest
 amounts of computation to get a result of any methods in CoordPacker. However, because it will cause cells to be
 considered "on" that would cause an exception if directly converted to x,y positions and accessed in the source
 2D array, this method should primarily be used in conjunction with operations such as intersectPacked(), or have
 the checking for boundaries handled internally by unpack() or related methods such as unpackMultiDouble().</div>

<div class="block">Given a packed data array that encodes multiple unconnected "on" areas, this finds each isolated area (areas that
 are only adjacent diagonally are considered separate from each other) and returns it as an element in an
 ArrayList of short[], with one short[] array per isolated area. Useful when you have, for example, all the rooms
 in a dungeon with their connecting corridors removed, but want to separate the rooms. You can get the
 aforementioned data assuming a bare dungeon called map with WIDTH and HEIGHT constants using:
 <br>
 <code>short[] floors = pack(map, '.'),
 rooms = flood(floors, retract(floors, 1, WIDTH, HEIGHT, true), 2, false),
 corridors = differencePacked(floors, rooms),
 doors = intersectPacked(rooms, fringe(corridors, 1, WIDTH, HEIGHT, false));</code>
 <br>
 You can then get all rooms as separate regions with <code>List&lt;short[]&gt; apart = split(rooms);</code>, or substitute
 <code>split(corridors)</code> to get the corridors. The room-finding technique works by shrinking floors by a radius
 of 1 (8-way), which causes thin areas like corridors of 2 or less width to be removed, then flood-filling the
 floors out from the area that produces by 2 cells (4-way this time) to restore the original size of non-corridor
 areas (plus some extra to ensure odd shapes are kept). Corridors are obtained by removing the rooms from floors.
 The example code also gets the doors (which overlap with rooms, not corridors) by finding where the a room and a
 corridor are adjacent. This technique is used with some enhancements in the RoomFinder class.</div>
