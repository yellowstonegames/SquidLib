<pre>public class <a href="../../src-html/squidpony/squidmath/RNG.html#line.111">RNG</a>
extends java.lang.Object
implements java.io.Serializable, <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/IRNG.html" title="interface in squidpony.squidmath">IRNG</a></pre>
<div class="block">A wrapper class for working with random number generators in a more friendly way.
 Implements <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/IRNG.html" title="interface in squidpony.squidmath"><code>IRNG</code></a>, which covers most of the API surface, but RNG implements
 a decent amount of additional methods. You should consider if your code needs
 these additional methods, and if not you should use IRNG as the type for when you
 need some random number generator.
 <p>
 Includes methods for getting values between two numbers and for getting
 random elements from a collection or array. There are methods to shuffle
 a collection and to get a random ordering that can be applied as one shuffle
 across multiple collections, such as via <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/OrderedMap.html#reorder-int...-"><code>OrderedMap.reorder(int...)</code></a>,
 <a href="../../squidpony/ArrayTools.html#reorder-java.util.ArrayList-int...-"><code>ArrayTools.reorder(ArrayList, int...)</code></a>, and so on. You can construct
 an RNG with all sorts of RandomnessSource implementations, and choosing them
 is usually not a big concern because the default works very well. If you target
 GWT, then it is suggested that you use <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/GWTRNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>GWTRNG</code></a> instead of RNG; both
 implement <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/IRNG.html" title="interface in squidpony.squidmath"><code>IRNG</code></a>, which is enough for most usage across SquidLib, but
 GWTRNG is optimized heavily for better performance on GWT, even returning long
 values faster than implementations that natively do their math on longs. It has
 worse performance on 64-bit PCs and mobile devices, but should also have better
 performance on 32-bit PCs and mobile devices.
 <br>
 But if you do want advice on what RandomnessSource to use... <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/DiverRNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>DiverRNG</code></a>
 is the default, and is the fastest generator that passes most tests and can
 produce all 64-bit values, and though relative to many of the others it has a
 significantly shorter period (the amount of random numbers it will go through
 before repeating the sequence), this almost never matters in games, and is
 primarily relevant for massively-parallel scientific programs. DiverRNG has a
 period of <code>pow(2, 64)</code> as opposed to <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/XoRoRNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>XoRoRNG</code></a>'s
 <code>pow(2, 128) - 1</code>, or <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/LongPeriodRNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>LongPeriodRNG</code></a>'s <code>pow(2, 1024) - 1</code>.
 <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/LightRNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>LightRNG</code></a> is a solid choice and a former default RandomnessSource;
 additional features of LightRNG are exposed in <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/MoonwalkRNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>MoonwalkRNG</code></a> and using
 MoonwalkRNG is recommended if you need unusual features like skipping backwards
 in a random number sequence, taking a result of a nextLong() call and reversing
 it to get the state that produced it, or calculating the distance in number of
 nextLong() calls between two results of nextLong() calls. LightRNG is a
 StatefulRandomness, which lets it be used in <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/StatefulRNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>StatefulRNG</code></a>, and so is
 DiverRNG, but LightRNG is also a <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/SkippingRandomness.html" title="interface in squidpony.squidmath"><code>SkippingRandomness</code></a>, which means you can
 leap forward or backwards in its sequence very efficiently (DiverRNG is not a
 SkippingRandomness). <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/ThrustAltRNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>ThrustAltRNG</code></a> provides similar qualities to LightRNG,
 and is one of the fastest generators here, but can't produce all possible 64-bit
 values (possibly some 32-bit values as well); it was the default at one point so
 you may want to keep compatibility with some versions by specifying ThrustAltRNG.
 The defaults have changed in the past as issues are found in various generators;
 LightRNG has high quality all-around but is slower than the other defaults,
 ThrustAltRNG can't produce all results, LinnormRNG passed tests in an earlier
 version of the PractRand test suite but now fails in the current version, and now
 the default is DiverRNG, which shares the known issue of LightRNG and LinnormRNG
 that it can't produce the same result twice from <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/RNG.html#nextLong--"><code>nextLong()</code></a> until the
 generator exhausts its period and repeats its output from the beginning.
 For most cases, you should decide between DiverRNG, ThrustAltRNG, LightRNG,
 LongPeriodRNG, MiniMover64RNG, and XoshiroStarPhi32RNG based on your priorities.
 Some tasks are better solved by using a different class, usually <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/GWTRNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>GWTRNG</code></a>,
 which can always be serialized on GWT to save its state easily and is usually the
 fastest substitute for RNG on that platform. DiverRNG is the best if you want high
 speed, very good quality of randomness, and expect to generate a reasonable quantity
 of numbers for a game (less than 18446744073709551616 numbers) without any single
 results being impossible. LightRNG is the second-best at the above criteria, but is
 the best option if you need an RNG that can skip backwards or jump forwards without
 incurring speed penalties. LongPeriodRNG is best if you for some reason need a massive
 amount of random numbers (as in, ten quintillion would be far too little) or want to
 split up such a large generator into unrelated subsequences. XoshiroStarPhi32RNG is
 best if GWT is a possible target but you either need to generate more than
 18446744073709551616 numbers (but less than 340282366920938463463374607431768211455
 numbers) or you need to ensure that each 128-bit chunk of output is unique; if GWT is
 a target but those specific needs don't matter, use GWTRNG. ThrustAltRNG and
 MiniMover64RNG are both faster than DiverRNG usually (MiniMover64RNG is the fastest),
 but because they are unable to generate some outputs, that may make them a poor choice
 for some usage (ThrustAltRNG also has some bias toward specific numbers and produces
 them more frequently, but not frequently enough to make it fail statistical tests, and
 ThrustAltRNG can skip around in its output sequence like LightRNG).
 <br>
 There are many more RandomnessSource implementations! You might want significantly less
 predictable random results, which  <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/IsaacRNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>IsaacRNG</code></a> can provide, along with a
 large period. The quality of <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/PermutedRNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>PermutedRNG</code></a> is also good, usually, and it
 has a sound basis in PCG-Random, an involved library with many variants on its
 RNGs.
 <br>
 There may be reasons why you would want a random number generator that uses 32-bit
 math instead of the more common 64-bit math, but using a 32-bit int on desktop and
 Android won't act the same as that same 32-bit int on GWT. Since GWT is stuck with
 JavaScript's implementation of ints with doubles, overflow (which is needed for an
 RNG) doesn't work with ints as expected, but does with GWT's implementation of longs.
 If targeting GWT, you should probably consider <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/GWTRNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>GWTRNG</code></a> or <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/SilkRNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>SilkRNG</code></a>,
 which would be used in place of this class and have a similar API. You can instead
 choose a RandomnessSource that is efficient on GWT; <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/Lathe32RNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>Lathe32RNG</code></a> is
 significantly faster at producing int values on GWT than any long-based generator,
 and will produce the same results on GWT as on desktop or Android (not all 32-bit
 generators do this). <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/Starfish32RNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>Starfish32RNG</code></a> goes one step further than Lathe32RNG at
 an even distribution, and has better quality, but is slightly slower; it is also used
 internally by GWTRNG. While Lathe32RNG can produce all ints over the course of its
 period, it will produce some pairs of ints, or longs, more often than others and will
 never produce some longs. Starfish32RNG will produce all longs but one.
 <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/Oriole32RNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>Oriole32RNG</code></a> and <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/XoshiroStarPhi32RNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>XoshiroStarPhi32RNG</code></a> are also GWT-safe, but other
 generators that were thought to be GWT-friendly are not. <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/PintRNG.html" title="class in squidpony.squidmath"><code>PintRNG</code></a> is a
 GWT-unsafe generators with other uses, but should not be used on GWT. All other
 RandomnessSources use longs, and so will be slower than the recommended Starfish32RNG
 or Lathe32RNG on GWT, but probably are much faster on 64-bit JREs.</div>

 large ranges, but the amount of bias is incredibly small (expected to be under 1/1000 if enough random ranged

 noticeable bias if the generator's period is exhausted by only calls to this method. Unlike all unbiased methods,
 this advances the state by an equivalent to exactly one call to <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/RNG.html#nextLong--"><code>nextLong()</code></a>, where rejection sampling

 This method changed a fair amount on April 5, 2018 to better support RandomnessSource implementations with a

 large (the estimate is still at least a bound of a billion or more before issues are observable). Consider
 <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/RNG.html#nextSignedInt-int-"><code>nextSignedInt(int)</code></a> if the bound should be allowed to be negative; <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/RNG.html#nextIntHasty-int-"><code>nextIntHasty(int)</code></a> is here for

<div class="block">Generates a random 64-bit long with a number of '1' bits (Hamming weight) equal on average to bitCount.
 For example, calling this with a parameter of 32 will be equivalent to calling nextLong() on this object's
 RandomnessSource (it doesn't consider overridden nextLong() methods, where present, on subclasses of RNG).
 Calling this with a parameter of 16 will have on average 16 of the 64 bits in the returned long set to '1',
 distributed pseudo-randomly, while a parameter of 47 will have on average 47 bits set. This can be useful for
 certain code that uses bits to represent data but needs a different ratio of set bits to unset bits than 1:1.
 <br>
 This method is deprecated because it really only finds usage in GreasedRegion, so it has been moved there and
 made so it can take any RandomnessSource as a parameter, including any IRNG or RNG.</div>

 hold up to 255 x and 255 y for positive values, and the pool should be grown with the static method
 Coord.expandPool() in order to efficiently use larger Coord values. If width and height are very large,
 greater than 100,000 for either, this particular method may show bias toward certain positions due to
 the "hasty" technique used to reduce the random numbers to the given size, but because most maps in
 tile-based games are relatively small, this technique should be fine.
