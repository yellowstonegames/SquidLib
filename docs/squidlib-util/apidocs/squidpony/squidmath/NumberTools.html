<div class="block">Various numeric functions that are important to performance but need alternate implementations on GWT to obtain it.
 Super-sourced on GWT, but most things here are direct calls to JDK methods when on desktop or Android.
 Some of this code makes use of "creative" bit manipulation of floats and doubles, which can sometimes allow uncommon
 input-to-output patterns (as in <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/NumberTools.html#bounce-float-"><code>bounce(float)</code></a>), or even can yield a performance boost (compare
 <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/NumberTools.html#zigzag-float-"><code>zigzag(float)</code></a> to using modulus to accomplish the same results). The bit manipulation has good performance on
 GWT thanks to JS typed arrays, which are well-supported now across all recent browsers and have fallbacks in GWT in
 the unlikely event of a browser not supporting them.</div>

<div class="block">Makes a modified version of value that uses the specified bits (up to 12) for its exponent and sign.
 Meant for some specific cases, like adjusting the exponent on an unknown double to the 1.0 to 2.0 range (which
 would pass 0x3ff for exponentBits). If you have a double from 1.0 to 2.0, you can subtract 1.0 from it to get the
 often-desirable 0.0-1.0 range. Other common cases are 0x400, which adjusts to between 2.0 and 4.0 (subtracting
 3.0 from this gives the -1.0 to 1.0 range, useful for noise), and 0xBFF, which adjusts to between -2.0 and -1.0.
 For the last case, you might think that -0x3ff would work, but sadly it doesn't. You can use
 <code>exponentBits |= 0x800</code> to set the sign bit to negative, or <code>exponentBits &amp;= 0x7ff</code> for positive.</div>

 slows its range of change, but can return any value from 0 to 6.283185307179586f, or pi * 2. The pattern this
 will produces will be completely different if the seed changes, and the value is expected to be something other
 than an angle, like time. Uses a simple method of cubic interpolation between random values, where a random value
 is used without modification when given an integer for <code>value</code>. Note that this uses a different type of
 interpolation than <a href="../../squidpony/squidmath/NumberTools.html#sway-float-"><code>sway(float)</code></a>, which uses quintic (this causes swayAngleRandomized() to be slightly

 Takes y and x (in that unusual order) as doubles, and returns the angle from the origin to that point in radians.
 It is about 5 times faster than <code>Math.atan2(double, double)</code> (roughly 12 ns instead of roughly 62 ns for

 MathUtils seems to have worse average error, though.
