<span class="sourceLineNo">018</span> * to catch up!" can be transformed to "You hurry to catch up!" or "He hurries to catch up!". The rules are fairly<a name="line.18"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">019</span> * simple; @word conjugates a specific word from a list to the correct kind for the user, while ^word does a similar<a name="line.19"></a>

<span class="sourceLineNo">024</span> * $ or s chars will add es or nothing, as in the case of scratch becoming scratches, and using three will add ies or y,<a name="line.24"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">025</span> * as in the case of carry becoming carries. Some unusual pluralization forms are handled; @usi will turn octop@usi into<a name="line.25"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">026</span> * octopus or octopi, and radi@usi into radius or radii, while @fves will turn el@fves into elf or elves, or dwar@fves<a name="line.26"></a>
