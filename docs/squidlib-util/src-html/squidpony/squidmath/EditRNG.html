<span class="sourceLineNo">005</span>/**<a name="line.5"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">006</span> * A subclass of StatefulRNG (and thus RNG) that allows customizing many parts of the random number generation.<a name="line.6"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">007</span> * This is meant to be a more comprehensible version of the functionality present in RandomBias, and also for it to be<a name="line.7"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">008</span> * easier to use with methods that expect an RNG.<a name="line.8"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">009</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.9"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">010</span> * You can change the expected average for the values this produces, which uses the RandomBias.EXPONENTIAL distribution,<a name="line.10"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">011</span> * with all the caveats it has: it strongly favors either high or low values when the average gets especially high or<a name="line.11"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">012</span> * low, but it can essentially cover all averages between 0.0 and 1.0 (this class limits it to 0.1 and 0.9, so other<a name="line.12"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">013</span> * techniques can be used effectively).<a name="line.13"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">014</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.14"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">015</span> * You can also affect the "centrality" of random numbers, causing more to occur near the expected average (a bell curve<a name="line.15"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">016</span> * effect), or cause more near extreme ends of the random number spectrum. In practice, centrality changes are hard to<a name="line.16"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">017</span> * notice, but may be useful to simulate certain effects. An example of centrality changes in existing games include the<a name="line.17"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">018</span> * Nintendo title Advance Wars 2, where a brutish commander could increase the amount of damage his units dealt but also<a name="line.18"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">019</span> * suffered unpredictability; attacks could deal even more or much less damage than normal without any way to build<a name="line.19"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">020</span> * tactics around it. Square Enix's Final Fantasy XII also notably differentiated certain weapons (axes, hammers, and<a name="line.20"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">021</span> * "hand-cannons") from other similar options by making them deal less predictable damage. In both cases the connotation<a name="line.21"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">022</span> * is that more randomness is fitting for a brute-force approach to combat where pre-planned strategies are less<a name="line.22"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">023</span> * emphasized. It should also be noted that increasing the frequency of extreme results makes small bonuses to defense<a name="line.23"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">024</span> * or offense typically less useful, and small penalties less harmful. The opposite can be true for a carefully tuned<a name="line.24"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">025</span> * game where the most common results are tightly clustered, and most target numbers are just slightly above the<a name="line.25"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">026</span> * ordinary average. In tabletop games, 1d20 and 3d6 have the same average, but 1d20 is uniform, where 3d6 is clustered<a name="line.26"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">027</span> * around 10 and 11, each the result of 1/8 of rolls on their own and 1/4 together. This makes the case where a +1 bonus<a name="line.27"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">028</span> * to succeed changes the outcome on approximately 5% of 1d20 rolls, regardless of the required number to succeed if it<a name="line.28"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">029</span> * is less than 20. However, a +1 bonus matters on a variable portion of 3d6 rolls; if you become able to succeed on a<a name="line.29"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">030</span> * 10 or 11 where that was a failure before, the bonus applies approximately 12.5% of the time. Becoming able to succeed<a name="line.30"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">031</span> * on an 18 where that was a failure before is essentially worthless, affecting less than 0.5% of rolls. This property<a name="line.31"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">032</span> * of centralized results should be considered if game balance and/or the lethality of combat is important. One lengthy<a name="line.32"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">033</span> * stretch of extreme results by enemies that work against the favor of a player character generally result in a dead<a name="line.33"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">034</span> * player character, and RNGs that make extreme results more common may seem particularly cruel to players.<a name="line.34"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">035</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.35"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">036</span> * This generator sets a field, rawLatest, every time a random number is produced. This stores a pseudo-random double<a name="line.36"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">037</span> * between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive) that is not subject to the bias an expected average introduces, and is<a name="line.37"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">038</span> * close to uniformly distributed. You should expect rawLatest to be higher when higher numbers are returned from a<a name="line.38"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">039</span> * method like nextInt(), and lower when lower numbers are returned. This can be useful for rare effects that should not<a name="line.39"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">040</span> * be drastically more or less likely when slight changes are made to the expected average; if the expected average is<a name="line.40"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">041</span> * 0.65, many more random doubles from nextDouble() will be between 0.95 and 1.0 (probably more than 10% of random<a name="line.41"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">042</span> * numbers), but rawLatest will only be between 0.95 and 1.0 for close to 5% of all generations.<a name="line.42"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">043</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.43"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">044</span> * You can get and set the state this uses internally, and this is stored as a 64-bit long.<a name="line.44"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">045</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.45"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">046</span> * The choice of RandomnessSource doesn't really matter since this will always use a LightRNG internally.<a name="line.46"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">047</span> * LightRNG is the current best StatefulRandomness implementation, with excellent performance characteristics and<a name="line.47"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">048</span> * few flaws, and though its relatively low period may sometimes be a detriment, all StatefulRandomness implementations<a name="line.48"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">049</span> * will have the same or lower period.<a name="line.49"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">050</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.50"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">051</span> * More customizations may be added in the future to the ones available currently.<a name="line.51"></a>
