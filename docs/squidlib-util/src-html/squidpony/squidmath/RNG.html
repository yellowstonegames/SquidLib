<span class="sourceLineNo">011</span> * A wrapper class for working with random number generators in a more friendly way.<a name="line.11"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">012</span> * Implements {@link IRNG}, which covers most of the API surface, but RNG implements<a name="line.12"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">013</span> * a decent amount of additional methods. You should consider if your code needs<a name="line.13"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">014</span> * these additional methods, and if not you should use IRNG as the type for when you<a name="line.14"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">015</span> * need some random number generator.<a name="line.15"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">016</span> * &lt;p&gt;<a name="line.16"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">017</span> * Includes methods for getting values between two numbers and for getting<a name="line.17"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">018</span> * random elements from a collection or array. There are methods to shuffle<a name="line.18"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">019</span> * a collection and to get a random ordering that can be applied as one shuffle<a name="line.19"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">020</span> * across multiple collections, such as via {@link OrderedMap#reorder(int...)},<a name="line.20"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">021</span> * {@link ArrayTools#reorder(ArrayList, int...)}, and so on. You can construct<a name="line.21"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">022</span> * an RNG with all sorts of RandomnessSource implementations, and choosing them<a name="line.22"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">023</span> * is usually not a big concern because the default works very well. If you target<a name="line.23"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">024</span> * GWT, then it is suggested that you use {@link GWTRNG} instead of RNG; both<a name="line.24"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">025</span> * implement {@link IRNG}, which is enough for most usage across SquidLib, but<a name="line.25"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">026</span> * GWTRNG is optimized heavily for better performance on GWT, even returning long<a name="line.26"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">027</span> * values faster than implementations that natively do their math on longs. It has<a name="line.27"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">028</span> * worse performance on 64-bit PCs and mobile devices, but should also have better<a name="line.28"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">029</span> * performance on 32-bit PCs and mobile devices.<a name="line.29"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">030</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.30"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">031</span> * But if you do want advice on what RandomnessSource to use... {@link LinnormRNG}<a name="line.31"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">032</span> * is the default, and is the fastest generator that passes stringent tests, but<a name="line.32"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">033</span> * relative to many of the others it has a significantly shorter period (the<a name="line.33"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">034</span> * amount of random  numbers it will go through before repeating the sequence),<a name="line.34"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">035</span> * at {@code pow(2, 64)} as opposed to {@link XoRoRNG}'s {@code pow(2, 128) - 1},<a name="line.35"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">036</span> * or {@link LongPeriodRNG}'s {@code pow(2, 1024) - 1}. {@link LightRNG} is a solid<a name="line.36"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">037</span> * choice and the former default RandomnessSource; additional features of LightRNG<a name="line.37"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">038</span> * are exposed in {@link MoonwalkRNG} and using MoonwalkRNG is recommended if you<a name="line.38"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">039</span> * need unusual features like skipping backwards in a random number sequence, taking<a name="line.39"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">040</span> * a result of a nextLong() call and reversing it to get the state that produced it,<a name="line.40"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">041</span> * or calculating the distance in number of nextLong() calls between two results of<a name="line.41"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">042</span> * nextLong() calls. LightRNG is a StatefulRandomness, which lets it be used in<a name="line.42"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">043</span> * {@link StatefulRNG}, and so is LinnormRNG, but LightRNG is also a<a name="line.43"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">044</span> * {@link SkippingRandomness}, which means you can leap forward or backwards in<a name="line.44"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">045</span> * its sequence very efficiently (LinnormRNG is not a SkippingRandomness).<a name="line.45"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">046</span> * {@link ThrustAltRNG} provides similar qualities to LightRNG,<a name="line.46"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">047</span> * and can be faster, but can't produce all possible 64-bit values (possibly some 32-bit<a name="line.47"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">048</span> * values as well); it was the default at one point so you may want to keep compatibility<a name="line.48"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">049</span> * with some versions by specifying ThrustAltRNG (before and after ThrustAltRNG was the<a name="line.49"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">050</span> * default, LightRNG was used). For most cases, you should decide between<a name="line.50"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">051</span> * LinnormRNG, ThrustAltRNG, LightRNG, LongPeriodRNG, and XoRoRNG based on your priorities.<a name="line.51"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">052</span> * LinnormRNG is the best if you want high speed, very good quality of randomness, and<a name="line.52"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">053</span> * expect to either generate less than 18446744073709551616 numbers or don't care if<a name="line.53"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">054</span> * patterns appear after you generate that many numbers. LightRNG is the second-best at<a name="line.54"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">055</span> * the above criteria, but is the best option if you need an RNG that can skip backwards<a name="line.55"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">056</span> * or jump forwards without incurring speed penalties. LongPeriodRNG is best if you for some<a name="line.56"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">057</span> * reason need a massive amount of random numbers (as in, ten quintillion would be far too<a name="line.57"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">058</span> * little) or want to split up such a large generator into unrelated subsequences. XoRoRNG<a name="line.58"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">059</span> * is best if you want good speed and quality but need to generate more than<a name="line.59"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">060</span> * 18446744073709551616 numbers, though less than 340282366920938463463374607431768211456<a name="line.60"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">061</span> * numbers. ThrustAltRNG is faster than LinnormRNG usually, but its inability to generate<a name="line.61"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">062</span> * some outputs may make it a poor choice for some usage (it also has some bias toward<a name="line.62"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">063</span> * specific numbers and produces them more frequently, but not frequently enough to make it<a name="line.63"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">064</span> * fail statistical tests). {@link JabRNG} and {@link LapRNG} are competitors in the<a name="line.64"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">065</span> * no-quality-guarantees department; JabRNG is slightly slower than LapRNG but faster than<a name="line.65"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">066</span> * ThrustAltRNG, actually can pass a fair amount of quality tests, and can't produce a<a name="line.66"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">067</span> * majority of all possible 64-bit values. Its period is half that of ThrustAltRNG and<a name="line.67"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">068</span> * LightRNG, at 2 to the 63. LapRNG doesn't pass any tests, really, but it can fool a human<a name="line.68"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">069</span> * observer; its period is probably 2 to the 65 and it's incredibly fast but offers no<a name="line.69"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">070</span> * special features.<a name="line.70"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">071</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.71"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">072</span> * There are many more RandomnessSource implementations! You might want significantly less<a name="line.72"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">073</span> * predictable random results, which  {@link IsaacRNG} can provide, along with a<a name="line.73"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">074</span> * large period. The quality of {@link PermutedRNG} is also good, usually, and it<a name="line.74"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">075</span> * has a sound basis in PCG-Random, an involved library with many variants on its<a name="line.75"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">076</span> * RNGs.<a name="line.76"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">077</span> * There may be reasons why you would want a random number generator that uses 32-bit<a name="line.77"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">078</span> * math instead of the more common 64-bit math, but using a 32-bit int on desktop and<a name="line.78"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">079</span> * Android won't act the same as that same 32-bit int on GWT. Since GWT is stuck with<a name="line.79"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">080</span> * JavaScript's implementation of ints with doubles, overflow (which is needed for an<a name="line.80"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">081</span> * RNG) doesn't work with ints as expected, but does with GWT's implementation of longs.<a name="line.81"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">082</span> * If targeting GWT, {@link Lathe32RNG} is significantly faster at producing int values<a name="line.82"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">083</span> * than any long-based generator, and will produce the same results on GWT as on desktop<a name="line.83"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">084</span> * or Android (not all 32-bit generators do this). {@link ThrustAlt32RNG},<a name="line.84"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">085</span> * {@link Zag32RNG}, and {@link Oriole32RNG} are also GWT-safe, but other generators that<a name="line.85"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">086</span> * were thought to be GWT-friendly are not. These GWT-unsafe generators have other uses,<a name="line.86"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">087</span> * but should not be used on GWT: {@link PintRNG}, {@link Light32RNG},<a name="line.87"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">088</span> * and {@link FlapRNG}. All other generators use longs, and so will be<a name="line.88"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">089</span> * slower than the recommended Lathe32RNG on GWT, but much faster on 64-bit JREs.<a name="line.89"></a>
