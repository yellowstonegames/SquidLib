<span class="sourceLineNo">007</span>/**<a name="line.7"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">008</span> * A quasi-random number generator that goes through one of many sub-random sequences found by J.G. van der Corput.<a name="line.8"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">009</span> * More specifically, this offers both the normal van der Corput sequence, which only changes the state by incrementing<a name="line.9"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">010</span> * it (this works better in the normal usage as part of a 2D or 3D point generator) and a kind of scrambled van der<a name="line.10"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">011</span> * Corput sequence, where the state changes unpredictably (this works better when using this to generate 1D sequences,<a name="line.11"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">012</span> * or when the base may be larger than 7 or non-prime). In both cases, the state is internally stored in a 64-bit long<a name="line.12"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">013</span> * that is incremented once per generated number, but when scramble is true, the state is altered with something similar<a name="line.13"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">014</span> * to a Gray code before being used; more on this later if you want to read about it. The important things to know about<a name="line.14"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">015</span> * this class are: size of state affects speed (prefer smaller seeds, but quality is sometimes a bit poor at first if<a name="line.15"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">016</span> * you start at 0); the base (when given) should be prime and moderately small (or very small if scramble is false, any<a name="line.16"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">017</span> * of 2, 3, 5, or 7 should be safe); this doesn't generate very random numbers when scramble is false (which can be good<a name="line.17"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">018</span> * for making points that should not overlap), but it will seem much more random when scramble is true; this is a<a name="line.18"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">019</span> * StatefulRandomness with an additional method for generating quasi-random doubles, {@link #nextDouble()}; and there<a name="line.19"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">020</span> * are several static methods offered for convenient generation of points on the related Halton sequence (as well as<a name="line.20"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">021</span> * faster generation of doubles in the base-2 van der Corput sequence, and a special method that switches which base<a name="line.21"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">022</span> * it uses depending on the index to seem even less clearly-patterned).<a name="line.22"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">023</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.23"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">024</span> * This generator allows a base (also called a radix) that changes the sequence significantly; a base should be prime,<a name="line.24"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">025</span> * and this performs a little better in terms of time used with larger primes, though quality is also improved by<a name="line.25"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">026</span> * preferring primes that aren't very large relative to the quantity of numbers expected to be generated. Unfortunately,<a name="line.26"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">027</span> * performance is not especially similar to conventional PRNGs; smaller (positive) state values are processed more<a name="line.27"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">028</span> * quickly than larger ones, or most negative states. At least one 64-bit integer modulus and one 64-bit integer<a name="line.28"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">029</span> * division are required for any number to be produced, and the amount of both of these relatively-non-cheap operations<a name="line.29"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">030</span> * increases linearly with the number of digits (in the specified base, which is usually not 10) needed to represent<a name="line.30"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">031</span> * the current state. Since performance is not optimal, and the results are rather strange anyway relative to PRNGs,<a name="line.31"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">032</span> * this should not be used as a direct substitute for a typical RandomnessSource (however, it is similar to, but simpler<a name="line.32"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">033</span> * than, {@link squidpony.squidmath.SobolQRNG}). So what's it good for?<a name="line.33"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">034</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.34"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">035</span> * A VanDerCorputSequence can be a nice building block for more complicated quasi-randomness, especially for points in<a name="line.35"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">036</span> * 2D or 3D, when scramble is false. There's a simple way that should almost always "just work" as the static method<a name="line.36"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">037</span> * {@link #halton(int, int, int)} here. If it doesn't meet your needs, there's a little more complexity involved. Using<a name="line.37"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">038</span> * a VanDerCorputQRNG with base 3 for the x-axis and another VanDerCorputQRNG with base 5 for the y-axis, requesting a<a name="line.38"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">039</span> * double from each to make points between (0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0), has an interesting trait that can be desirable for<a name="line.39"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">040</span> * many kinds of positioning in 2D: once a point has been generated, an identical point will never be generated until<a name="line.40"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">041</span> * floating-point precision runs out, but more than that, nearby points will almost never be generated for many<a name="line.41"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">042</span> * generations, and most points will stay at a comfortable distance from each other if the bases are different and both<a name="line.42"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">043</span> * prime (as well as, more technically, if they share no common denominators). This is also known as a Halton sequence,<a name="line.43"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">044</span> * which is a group of sequences of points instead of simply numbers. The choices of 3 and 5 are just examples; any two<a name="line.44"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">045</span> * different primes will technically work for 2D, but patterns can become noticeable with primes larger than about 7,<a name="line.45"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">046</span> * with 11 and 13 sometimes acceptable. Three VanDerCorputQRNG sequences could be used for a Halton sequence of 3D<a name="line.46"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">047</span> * points, using three different prime bases, four for 4D, etc. SobolQRNG can be used for the same purpose, but the<a name="line.47"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">048</span> * points it generates are typically more closely-aligned to a specific pattern, the pattern is symmetrical between all<a name="line.48"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">049</span> * four quadrants of the square between (0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0) in 2D, and it probably extends into higher dimensions.<a name="line.49"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">050</span> * Using one of the possible Halton sequences gives some more flexibility in the kinds of random-like points produced.<a name="line.50"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">051</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.51"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">052</span> * Because just using the state in a simple incremental fashion puts some difficult requirements on the choice of base<a name="line.52"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">053</span> * and seed, we can use a technique like Gray codes to scramble the state. The sequence of these Gray-like codes for the<a name="line.53"></a>
