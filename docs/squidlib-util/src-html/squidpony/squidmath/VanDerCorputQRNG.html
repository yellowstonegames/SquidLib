<span class="sourceLineNo">008</span> * A quasi-random number generator that goes through one of many sub-random sequences found by J.G. van der Corput.<a name="line.8"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">009</span> * More specifically, this offers both the normal van der Corput sequence, which only changes the state by incrementing<a name="line.9"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">010</span> * it (this works better in the normal usage as part of a 2D or 3D point generator) and a kind of scrambled van der<a name="line.10"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">011</span> * Corput sequence, where the state changes unpredictably (this works better when using this to generate 1D sequences,<a name="line.11"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">012</span> * or when the base may be larger than 7 or non-prime). In both cases, the state is internally stored in a 64-bit long<a name="line.12"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">013</span> * that is incremented once per generated number, but when scramble is true, the state is altered with something similar<a name="line.13"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">014</span> * to a Gray code before being used; more on this later if you want to read about it. The important things to know about<a name="line.14"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">015</span> * this class are: size of state affects speed (prefer smaller seeds, but quality is sometimes a bit poor at first if<a name="line.15"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">016</span> * you start at 0); the base (when given) should be prime (smaller bases tend to yield better quality, but oddly, larger<a name="line.16"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">017</span> * bases perform better); this doesn't generate very random numbers when scramble is false (which can be good<a name="line.17"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">018</span> * for making points that should not overlap), but it will seem much more random when scramble is true; this is a<a name="line.18"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">019</span> * StatefulRandomness with an additional method for generating quasi-random doubles, {@link #nextDouble()}; and there<a name="line.19"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">020</span> * are several static methods offered for convenient generation of points on the related Halton sequence (as well as<a name="line.20"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">021</span> * faster generation of doubles in the base-2 van der Corput sequence, and a special method that switches which base<a name="line.21"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">022</span> * it uses depending on the index to seem even less clearly-patterned).<a name="line.22"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">023</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.23"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">024</span> * This generator allows a base (also called a radix) that changes the sequence significantly; a base should be prime,<a name="line.24"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">025</span> * and this performs better in terms of time used with larger primes, though quality is also improved by preferring<a name="line.25"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">026</span> * primes that aren't very large relative to the quantity of numbers expected to be generated. Unfortunately,<a name="line.26"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">027</span> * performance is not especially similar to conventional PRNGs; smaller (positive) state values are processed more<a name="line.27"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">028</span> * quickly than larger ones, or most negative states. At least one 64-bit integer modulus and one 64-bit integer<a name="line.28"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">029</span> * division are required for any number to be produced, and the amount of both of these relatively-non-cheap operations<a name="line.29"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">030</span> * increases linearly with the number of digits (in the specified base, which is usually not 10) needed to represent<a name="line.30"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">031</span> * the current state. Since performance is not optimal, and the results are rather strange anyway relative to PRNGs,<a name="line.31"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">032</span> * this should not be used as a direct substitute for a typical RandomnessSource (however, it is similar to, but simpler<a name="line.32"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">033</span> * and faster than, {@link SobolQRNG}). So what's it good for?<a name="line.33"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">034</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.34"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">035</span> * A VanDerCorputSequence can be a nice building block for more complicated quasi-randomness, especially for points in<a name="line.35"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">036</span> * 2D or 3D, when scramble is false. There's a simple way that should almost always "just work" as the static method<a name="line.36"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">037</span> * {@link #halton(int, int, int, int[])} here. If it doesn't meet your needs, there's a little more complexity involved.<a name="line.37"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">038</span> * Using a VanDerCorputQRNG with base 3 for the x-axis and another VanDerCorputQRNG with base 5 for the y-axis,<a name="line.38"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">039</span> * requesting a double from each to make points between (0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0), has an interesting trait that can be<a name="line.39"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">040</span> * desirable for many kinds of positioning in 2D: once a point has been generated, an identical point will never be<a name="line.40"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">041</span> * generated until floating-point precision runs out, but more than that, nearby points will almost never be generated<a name="line.41"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">042</span> * for many generations, and most points will stay at a comfortable distance from each other if the bases are different<a name="line.42"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">043</span> * and both prime (or, more technically, if they share no common denominators). This is also known as a Halton sequence,<a name="line.43"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">044</span> * which is a group of sequences of points instead of simply numbers. The choices of 3 and 5 are examples; any two<a name="line.44"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">045</span> * different primes will technically work for 2D (as well as any two numbers that share no common factor other than 1,<a name="line.45"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">046</span> * that is, they are relatively coprime), but patterns can be noticeable with primes larger than about 7, with 11 and 13<a name="line.46"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">047</span> * sometimes acceptable. Three VanDerCorputQRNG sequences could be used for a Halton sequence of 3D<a name="line.47"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">048</span> * points, using three different prime bases, four for 4D, etc. SobolQRNG can be used for the same purpose, but the<a name="line.48"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">049</span> * points it generates are typically more closely-aligned to a specific pattern, the pattern is symmetrical between all<a name="line.49"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">050</span> * four quadrants of the square between (0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0) in 2D, and it probably extends into higher dimensions.<a name="line.50"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">051</span> * Using one of the possible Halton sequences gives some more flexibility in the kinds of random-like points produced.<a name="line.51"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">052</span> * Oddly, using a base-2 van der Corput sequence as the x axis in a Halton sequence and a base-39 van der Corput<a name="line.52"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">053</span> * sequence as the y axis results in the greatest minimum distance between points found so far while still involving a<a name="line.53"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">054</span> * base-2 sequence (which is preferential for performance). There, the minimum distance between the first 65536 points<a name="line.54"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">055</span> * in the [0,1) range is 0.001147395; a runner-up is a y base of 13, which has a minimum distance of 0.000871727 . The<a name="line.55"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">056</span> * (2,39) Halton sequence is used by {@link #halton(int, int, int)} and {@link #halton(int, int, int, int[])}.<a name="line.56"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">057</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.57"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">058</span> * Because just using the state in a simple incremental fashion puts some difficult requirements on the choice of base<a name="line.58"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">059</span> * and seed, we can scramble the long state {@code i} with code equivalent to<a name="line.59"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">060</span> * {@code (i ^ Long.rotateLeft(i, 7) ^ Long.rotateLeft(i, 17))}. This scramble is different from earlier versions and<a name="line.60"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">061</span> * unlike the earlier ones has a one-to-one mapping from input states to scrambled states.<a name="line.61"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">062</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.62"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">063</span> * Created by Tommy Ettinger on 11/18/2016. Uses code adapted from<a name="line.63"></a>
