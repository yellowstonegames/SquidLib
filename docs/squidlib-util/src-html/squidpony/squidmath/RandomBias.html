<span class="sourceLineNo">007</span> * A class that wraps an RNG and allows different String keys to be associated with biases toward low or high results<a name="line.7"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">008</span> * when a method is called that gets a number from the wrapped RNG. With this, you could make a category of "blessed" or<a name="line.8"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">009</span> * "cursed" biases that, instead of using a uniform distribution that produces all numbers approximately with equal<a name="line.9"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">010</span> * likelihood (with doubles between 0.0 and 1.0 averaging at 0.5), have different averages, like 0.7 for blessed or 0.3<a name="line.10"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">011</span> * for cursed, when generating between 0.0 and 1.0. You could also use this to favor or disfavor the player for "easy<a name="line.11"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">012</span> * mode" or "hard mode" categories of play.<a name="line.12"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">013</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.13"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">014</span> * The API allows you to associate an alternative average with a kind as a String, like "blessed to-hit" or "hard mode<a name="line.14"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">015</span> * enemy damage", if you expect to use that number more than once and might want to tweak any averages by changing one<a name="line.15"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">016</span> * number at a later point. You can also give an average as a double in place of a kind as a String, which avoids a<a name="line.16"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">017</span> * HashMap lookup and lets you give flexibly-adjusted numbers, but does need more effort to change many values<a name="line.17"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">018</span> * throughout a codebase if averages aren't all generated by a formula. You can also set the distribution in the<a name="line.18"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">019</span> * constructor or by changing the public distribution field; you can use constants in this class, TRIANGULAR,<a name="line.19"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">020</span> * EXPONENTIAL, TRUNCATED, SOFT_TRIANGULAR, and EXP_TRI (the average of EXPONENTIAL and TRIANGULAR), for different<a name="line.20"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">021</span> * choices, with the default being EXP_TRI. Each one of these has different behavior regarding a preference toward<a name="line.21"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">022</span> * extreme values; TRIANGULAR almost never produces very high or very low values, EXPONENTIAL frequently produces the<a name="line.22"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">023</span> * highest or lowest values for high or low expected averages, respectively, TRUNCATED will simply never generate values<a name="line.23"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">024</span> * that are too far from the average (otherwise it's uniform), SOFT_TRIANGULAR will produce a rounded version of<a name="line.24"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">025</span> * TRIANGULAR's distribution with less of an angular peak and more frequent high and low values, and EXP_TRI will have<a name="line.25"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">026</span> * something like a curve shape that may "collide" slightly with the upper bound if the average is high enough.<a name="line.26"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">027</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.27"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">028</span> * Credit for the technique used for the exponential modification to distributions goes to user pjs on StackOverflow,<a name="line.28"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">029</span> * http://stackoverflow.com/a/17796997 .<a name="line.29"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">030</span> * Credit should also be given to user vydd of the LispGames community, who made a visualization of the distribution<a name="line.30"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">031</span> * changing as the expected average changed (at the time, the typical behavior of an exponential distribution looked<a name="line.31"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">032</span> * like a bug, and the visualization showed that it was correct behavior). Derrick Creamer noticed how strange the<a name="line.32"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">033</span> * exponential distribution would seem to most players, and that led to adding the simple triangular distribution.<a name="line.33"></a>
