<h1>Welcome to SquidLib's Documentation.</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/SquidPony/SquidLib">The main page, including source code, is on GitHub</a>.
All of the javadocs for the latest (built) version of code are in subdirectories of this site.
You can also download javadocs in a .jar for released versions of SquidLib using Maven, Gradle, or simply
by going to <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|squidlib">the Maven Central page for SquidLib</a>
and downloading the jars you want. As for javadocs...</p>
<ul>
<li>For the core of SquidLib, which can be used from any Java project, <a href="squidlib-util/apidocs/index.html">go here for squidlib-util</a>.</li>
<li>For the text rendering part of SquidLib, which uses libGDX, <a href="squidlib/apidocs/index.html">go here for squidlib</a>.</li>
<li>For the optional functionality of SquidLib (like handling saved files), which depends on libGDX only for its utilities, <a href="squidlib-extra/apidocs/index.html">go here for squidlib-extra</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Because visualizing what an SColor (from the text rendering part) looks like in contrast to others like it can be a
	challenge, there are some quickly-made large tables of every SColor defined by the library. You can view the colors
	<a href="ColorTable.html">sorted alphabetically by name</a>, <a href="ColorTableHue.html">sorted by hue</a>,
	or <a href="ColorTableValue.html">sorted from darkest to lightest</a>.
