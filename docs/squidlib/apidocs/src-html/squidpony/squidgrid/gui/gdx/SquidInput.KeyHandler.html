<span class="source-line-no">016</span><span id="line.16"> * modifies the input as it would on a QWERTY keyboard, and the exact mapping is documented in</span>
<span class="source-line-no">017</span><span id="line.17"> * {@link #fromCode(int, boolean)} as well. This class handles mouse input immediately, but stores keypresses in a</span>
<span class="source-line-no">018</span><span id="line.18"> * queue, storing all key events and allowing them to be processed one at a time using {@link #next()} or all at once</span>
<span class="source-line-no">019</span><span id="line.19"> * using {@link #drain()}. To have an effect, it needs to be registered by calling</span>
<span class="source-line-no">020</span><span id="line.20"> * {@link Input#setInputProcessor(InputProcessor)}. Note that calling {@link #hasNext()} does more than just check if</span>
<span class="source-line-no">021</span><span id="line.21"> * there are events that can be processed; because hasNext() is expected to be called frequently, it is also the point</span>
<span class="source-line-no">022</span><span id="line.22"> * where this class checks if a key is being held and so the next event should occur. Holding a key only causes the</span>
<span class="source-line-no">023</span><span id="line.23"> * keyDown() method of InputListener to be called once, so this uses hasNext() to see if there should be a next event</span>

<span class="source-line-no">025</span><span id="line.25"> * &lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="source-line-no">026</span><span id="line.26"> * This also allows some key remapping, including remapping so a key pressed with modifiers like Ctrl and Shift could</span>
<span class="source-line-no">027</span><span id="line.27"> * act like '?' (which could be used by expert players to avoid accidentally opening a help menu they don't need), and</span>
<span class="source-line-no">028</span><span id="line.28"> * that would free up '?' for some other use that could also be remapped. The remap() methods do much of this, often</span>
<span class="source-line-no">029</span><span id="line.29"> * with help from {@link #combineModifiers(char, boolean, boolean, boolean)}, while the unmap() methods allow removal of</span>

<span class="source-line-no">033</span><span id="line.33"> * in an event-driven libGDX game and should not step on the toes of libGDX's input handling. To block game logic</span>
<span class="source-line-no">034</span><span id="line.34"> * until an event has been received, check hasNext() in the game's render() method and effectively "block" by not</span>

<span class="source-line-no">036</span><span id="line.36"> * {@link #next()}. Mouse inputs do not affect hasNext(), and next() will process only key pressed events. Also, see</span>
