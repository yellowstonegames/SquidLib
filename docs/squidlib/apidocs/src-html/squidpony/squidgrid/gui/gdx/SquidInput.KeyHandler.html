<span class="sourceLineNo">009</span> * This input processing class can handle mouse and keyboard input, using a squidpony.squidgrid.gui.gdx.SquidMouse for<a name="line.9"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">010</span> * Mouse input and a user implementation of the SquidInput.KeyHandler interface to react to keys represented as chars<a name="line.10"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">011</span> * and the modifiers those keys were pressed with, any of alt, ctrl, and/or shift. Not all keys are representable by<a name="line.11"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">012</span> * default in unicode, so symbolic representations are stored in constants in this class, and are passed to<a name="line.12"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">013</span> * {@link KeyHandler#handle(char, boolean, boolean, boolean)} as chars like DOWN_ARROW or its value, '\u2193'. Shift<a name="line.13"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">014</span> * modifies the input as it would on a QWERTY keyboard, and the exact mapping is documented in<a name="line.14"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">015</span> * {@link #fromCode(int, boolean)} as well. This class handles mouse input immediately, but stores keypresses in a<a name="line.15"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">016</span> * queue, storing all key events and allowing them to be processed one at a time using {@link #next()} or all at once<a name="line.16"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">017</span> * using {@link #drain()}. To have an effect, it needs to be registered by calling<a name="line.17"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">018</span> * {@link Input#setInputProcessor(InputProcessor)}. Note that calling {@link #hasNext()} does more than just check if<a name="line.18"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">019</span> * there are events that can be processed; because hasNext() is expected to be called frequently, it is also the point<a name="line.19"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">020</span> * where this class checks if a key is being held and so the next event should occur. Holding a key only causes the<a name="line.20"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">021</span> * keyDown() method of InputListener to be called once, so this uses hasNext() to see if there should be a next event<a name="line.21"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">022</span> * coming from a held key.<a name="line.22"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">023</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.23"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">024</span> * This also allows some key remapping, including remapping so a key pressed with modifiers like Ctrl and Shift could<a name="line.24"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">025</span> * act like '?' (which could be used by expert players to avoid accidentally opening a help menu they don't need), and<a name="line.25"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">026</span> * that would free up '?' for some other use that could also be remapped. The remap() methods do much of this, often<a name="line.26"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">027</span> * with help from {@link #combineModifiers(char, boolean, boolean, boolean)}, while the unmap() methods allow removal of<a name="line.27"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">028</span> * any no-longer-wanted remappings.<a name="line.28"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">029</span> * &lt;br&gt;<a name="line.29"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">030</span> * It does not perform the blocking functionality of earlier SquidKey implementations, because this is meant to run<a name="line.30"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">031</span> * in an event-driven libGDX game and should not step on the toes of libGDX's input handling. To block game logic<a name="line.31"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">032</span> * until an event has been received, check hasNext() in the game's render() method and effectively "block" by not<a name="line.32"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">033</span> * running game logic if hasNext() returns false. You can process an event if hasNext() returns true by calling <a name="line.33"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">034</span> * {@link #next()}. Mouse inputs do not affect hasNext(), and next() will process only key pressed events. Also, see<a name="line.34"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">035</span> * above about the extra behavior of hasNext regarding held keys.<a name="line.35"></a>
