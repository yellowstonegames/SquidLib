 * This class largely supersedes the earlier {@link SColorFactory} class, and supports similar operations
 * while also allowing filters to modify the returned colors. Some things use different terms between the
 * two classes; {@link SColorFactory#blend(SColor, SColor, double)} is {@link #lerp(Color, Color, double)}
 * here, and {@link SColorFactory#setFloor(int)} is {@link #setGranularity(int)} (with different behavior).
