/**
 * Default BitmapFonts, a sample image, "stretchable" fonts and icons, and a central RNG for use with LibGDX.
 * All but one of the resources here need to be downloaded separately, to avoid bloating the size of the dependency jar
 * with many fonts that a game probably won't use. You can download assets in a jar with a release of SquidLib, or
 * individually from https://github.com/SquidPony/SquidLib/tree/master/assets . The assets you choose should go in the
 * android/assets (core/assets if you don't have an Android project) subfolder of your game if you use the normal libGDX
 * setup tool or SquidSetup, or the assets subfolder if you use czyzby's alternate setup tool,
 * https://github.com/czyzby/gdx-setup . They should not be placed in subdirectories of assets, otherwise this won't be
 * able to find them.
 * <br>
 * The fonts provided are mostly monospaced, with most looking rather similar (straight orthogonal lines and right-angle
 * curves), but some that look... better than the rest. For monospaced fonts that could be used on a grid in SquidPanel
 * or SquidLayers, it is recommended that you use a "stretchable" font (which use a signed distance field, or SDF,
 * effect to stretch smoothly) or a "crisp" font (which use a multi-channel signed distance field, or MSDF, effect to
 * stretch smoothly and remain sharp at very high zooms). For some usage you may want a TextFamily instead of a normal
 * TextCellFactory or BitmapFont; these TextFamily fonts store regular, bold, italic, and bold-italic faces in one file,
 * and {@link GDXMarkup} can produce text that will render in those faces. Some good choices for fonts here are
 * Iosevka, which comes in a sans-serif version with {@link #getStretchableLeanFont()}, {@link #getCrispLeanFont()}, 
 * {@link #getCrispLeanFamily()}, and more, as well as a slab-serif version with {@link #getStretchableSlabFont()},
 * {@link #getCrispSlabFont()}, and {@link #getCrispSlabFamily()}, among others, as well as Inconsolata-LGC, which is
 * more geometric sans-serif accessible with {@link #getStretchableFont()}, or (well-suited for square glyphs)
 * {@link #getStretchableSquareFont()} (it does not have a crisp variety). Another is Computer Modern, accessible by
 * {@link #getStretchableTypewriterFont()}, which has a chunky, ornamented style. For variable-width fonts
 * that can be used in TextPanel and LinesPanel, among others, you can use the recommended crisp font family Noto Serif
 * with {@link #getCrispPrintFamily()}, or for stretchable fonts there's the serif font Gentium with
 * {@link #getStretchablePrintFont()} or Noto Sans with {@link #getStretchableCleanFont()} (Noto Sans currently has
 * problems that Noto Serif does not have). All of the fonts so far support the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets.
 * <br>
 * If you can't decide, go with {@link #getCrispLeanFont()} or {@link #getCrispSlabFont()}, which return TextCellFactory
 * objects, and call their .width(int), .height(int), and .initBySize() methods to make them the size (and aspect ratio)
 * you want. You can use stretchable or crisp fonts with equal width and height to make
 * a horizontally-stretched version of a square font instead of the existing square fonts that add blank space.
 * <br>
 * The most Latin script support for a monospaced font is in the font Mandrill, accessible by getDefaultUnicodeFont()
 * and getLargeUnicodeFont() in two different sizes, and the latter should be suitable for everything from Spanish and
 * French, to Polish to Vietnamese. You can use Gentium for even better language support with a variable-width font in
 * LinesPanel or the like; it is accessible with getStretchablePrintFont(). Google's Noto font also supports many glyphs
 * in a variable-width format; it is accessible with getStretchableCleanFont() but may have some issues with baseline
 * level changing and character-to-character alignment seeming too high or low.
 * <br>
 * The sample image is a tentacle taken from a public domain icon collection graciously released by Henrique Lazarini;
 * it's fitting for SquidLib to have a tentacle as a logo or something, I guess?
 * <br>
 * The icons are from http://game-icons.net , there are over 2000 of them, and they're among the only images that should
 * both be recolor-able easily (like chars in a font) and resize-able easily if you use a stretchable font at the same
 * time. The stretchable font TextCellFactories do some work with shaders that makes most images look incorrect, but
 * allow distance field fonts and these distance field icons to resize smoothly. Mixing stretchable fonts with
 * non-stretchable images or fonts is not a great idea, and usually involves a slow shader change back and forth.
 * <br>
 * You can get a default RNG with getGuiRandom(); this should probably not be reused for non-GUI-related randomness,
 * but is meant instead to be used wherever randomized purely-aesthetic effects are needed, such as a jiggling effect.

     * distorted/stretched version of an existing font. This font only supports ASCII, and as said before, it doesn't
     * have separate lower-case letters. Note: if you use this font as-is, most characters will overlap slightly with
     * each other, which can be an aesthetic benefit in some styles but can also be hard to read, at least if the colors
     * aren't different between overlapping characters. For that reason, you may want to tweak the width and height of
     * this font after passing it to a SquidLayers or SparseLayers; often you would pass 0.875 times the original
     * width and height to {@link TextCellFactory#tweakWidth(float)} and {@link TextCellFactory#tweakHeight(float)}.
