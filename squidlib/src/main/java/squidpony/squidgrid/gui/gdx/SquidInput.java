/**
 * This input processing class can handle mouse and keyboard input, using a squidpony.squidgrid.gui.gdx.SquidMouse for
 * Mouse input and a user implementation of the SquidInput.KeyHandler interface to react to keys represented as chars
 * and the modifiers those keys were pressed with, any of alt, ctrl, and/or shift. Not all keys are representable by
 * default in unicode, so symbolic representations are stored in constants in this class, and are passed to
 * {@link KeyHandler#handle(char, boolean, boolean, boolean)} as chars like DOWN_ARROW or its value, '\u2193'. Shift
 * modifies the input as it would on a QWERTY keyboard, and the exact mapping is documented in
 * {@link #fromCode(int, boolean)} as well. This class handles mouse input immediately, but stores keypresses in a
 * queue, storing all key events and allowing them to be processed one at a time using {@link #next()} or all at once
 * using {@link #drain()}. To have an effect, it needs to be registered by calling
 * {@link Input#setInputProcessor(InputProcessor)}. Note that calling {@link #hasNext()} does more than just check if
 * there are events that can be processed; because hasNext() is expected to be called frequently, it is also the point
 * where this class checks if a key is being held and so the next event should occur. Holding a key only causes the
 * keyDown() method of InputListener to be called once, so this uses hasNext() to see if there should be a next event
 * coming from a held key.
 * <br>
 * This also allows some key remapping, including remapping so a key pressed with modifiers like Ctrl and Shift could
 * act like '?' (which could be used by expert players to avoid accidentally opening a help menu they don't need), and
 * that would free up '?' for some other use that could also be remapped. The remap() methods do much of this, often
 * with help from {@link #combineModifiers(char, boolean, boolean, boolean)}, while the unmap() methods allow removal of
 * any no-longer-wanted remappings.
 * <br>
 * It does not perform the blocking functionality of earlier SquidKey implementations, because this is meant to run
 * in an event-driven libGDX game and should not step on the toes of libGDX's input handling. To block game logic
 * until an event has been received, check hasNext() in the game's render() method and effectively "block" by not
 * running game logic if hasNext() returns false. You can process an event if hasNext() returns true by calling 
 * {@link #next()}. Mouse inputs do not affect hasNext(), and next() will process only key pressed events. Also, see
 * above about the extra behavior of hasNext regarding held keys.

    /**
     * Maps keycodes to unicode chars, sometimes depending on whether the Shift key is held.
     *
     * It is strongly recommended that you refer to key combinations regarding non-alphabet keys by using, for example,
     * Ctrl-Shift-; instead of Ctrl-:, that is to use the unshifted key with Shift instead of assuming that all
     * keyboards will use the QWERTY layout. Pressing shift while pressing just about any representable symbol will map
     * to the shifted version as if on a QWERTY keyboard, and if you don't have a QWERTY keyboard, the mappings are
     * documented in full below.
     *
     * Keys 'a' to 'z' report 'A' to 'Z' when shift is held. Non-ASCII-Latin characters do not have this behavior, since
     * most keyboards would be unable to send keys for a particular language and A-Z are very common. You can still
     * allow a response to, e.g. 'ä' and 'Ä' separately by checking for whether Shift was pressed in conjunction with
     * 'ä' on a keyboard with that key, which can be useful when users can configure their own keyboard layouts.
     *
     * Top row numbers map as follows:
     *
     * {@literal '1' to '!', '2' to '@', '3' to '#', '4' to '$', '5' to '%',}
     * {@literal '6' to '^', '7' to '&amp;', '8' to '*', '9' to '(', '0' to ')'}
     *
     * Numpad numbers will report a SquidInput constant such as UP_LEFT_ARROW for Numpad 7, but only if numpadDirections
     * is true; otherwise they send the number (here, 7). Numpad 0 sends VERTICAL_ARROW or 0.
     *
     * Most symbol keys are mapped to a single unicode char as a constant in SquidInput and disregard Shift. The
     * constant is usually the same as the name of the char; possible exceptions are Backspace (on PC) or Delete (on
     * Mac) mapping to BACKSPACE, Delete (on PC) mapping to FORWARD_DELETE, Esc mapping to ESCAPE, and Enter (on PC) or
     * Return (on Mac) mapping to ENTER.
     *
     * {@literal ':', '*', '#', '@'}, and space keys, if present, always map to themselves, regardless of Shift.
     *
     * Other characters map as follows when Shift is held, as they would on a QWERTY keyboard:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code ','} to {@code '<'}</li>
     * <li>{@code '.'} to {@code '>'}</li>
     * <li>{@code '/'} to {@code '?'}</li>
     * <li>{@code ';'} to {@code ':'}</li>
     * <li>{@code '\''} to {@code '"'}</li>
     * <li>{@code '['} to <code>'{'</code></li>
     * <li>{@code ']'} to <code>'}'</code></li>
     * <li>{@code '|'} to {@code '\\'}</li>
     * <li>{@code '-'} to {@code '_'}</li>
     * <li>{@code '+'} to {@code '='}</li>
     * <li>{@code '`'} to {@code '~'} (note, this key produces no event on the GWT backend)</li>
     * </ul>
     * @param keycode a keycode as passed by LibGDX
     * @param shift true if Shift key is being held.
     * @return a char appropriate to the given keycode; often uses shift to capitalize or change a char, but not for keys like the arrow keys that normally don't produce chars
