/**
 * Various special effects that can be applied to a {@link SquidPanel} or {@link SparseLayers} as an
 * {@link com.badlogic.gdx.scenes.scene2d.Action}. The PanelEffect class is abstract and has implementations as static
 * inner classes, such as {@link ExplosionEffect}. Each PanelEffect specifically affects one {@link IPackedColorPanel}
 * (an interface that both SquidPanel and SparseLayers implement), which can be a layer in a SquidLayers object or a
 * SquidPanel/SparseLayers on its own. By adding the PanelEffect to any actor using
 * {@link com.badlogic.gdx.scenes.scene2d.Actor#addAction(Action)} when the Actor has its act() method called after the
 * normal map parts of the panel have been placed, the PanelEffect will advance and change what chars/colors are in
 * the panel as specified in its implementation of the {@link #update(float)} method. Typically the Actor you add this
 * to is the SquidPanel or SparseLayers this affects, but it could also be a SquidLayers. Most PanelEffect
 * implementations should allow most configuration to be set in their constructors.
