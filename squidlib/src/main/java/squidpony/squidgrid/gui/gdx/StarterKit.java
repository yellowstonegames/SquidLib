     * action, undo it back to the snapshot, and try again. It can also be useful for saving the game and reloading it
     * exactly, though the optional serialization in squidlib-extra also does this. You can pass a GWTRNG to anything
     * that expects an IRNG, and you'll encounter a lot of methods that employ IRNG (and some that specifically require
     * or prefer {@link squidpony.squidmath.IStatefulRNG}, which includes GWTRNG) throughout squidlib-util.
