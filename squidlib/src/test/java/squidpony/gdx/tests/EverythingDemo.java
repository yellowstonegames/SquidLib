/**
 * This is a small, not-overly-simple demo that presents some important features of SquidLib and shows a faster,
 * cleaner, and more recently-introduced way of displaying the map and other text. Features include dungeon map
 * generation, field of view, pathfinding (to the mouse position), simplex noise (used for a flickering torch effect),
 * language generation/ciphering, a colorful glow effect, and ever-present random number generation (with a seed).
 * You can increase the size of the map on most target platforms (but GWT struggles with large... anything) by
 * changing gridHeight and gridWidth to affect the visible area or bigWidth and bigHeight to adjust the size of the
 * dungeon you can move through, with the camera following your '@' symbol.
 * <br>
 * The assets folder of this project, if it was created with SquidSetup, will contain the necessary font files (just one
 * .fnt file and one .png are needed, but many more are included by default). You should move any font files you don't
 * use out of the assets directory when you produce a release JAR, APK, or GWT build.

        // choose x and y positions until a floor is found, but particularly on dungeons with few floor cells, this can
        // have serious problems -- if it takes too long to find a floor cell, either it needs to be able to figure out

        // keep trying forever on an all-wall map. There are better ways! These involve using a kind of specific storage
        // for points or regions, getting that to store only floors, and finding a random cell from that collection of
        // floors. The two kinds of such storage used commonly in SquidLib are the "packed data" as short[] produced by
        // CoordPacker (which use very little memory, but can be slow, and are treated as unchanging by CoordPacker so
        // any change makes a new array), and GreasedRegion objects (which use slightly more memory, tend to be faster
        // on almost all operations compared to the same operations with CoordPacker, and default to changing the
        // GreasedRegion object when you call a method on it instead of making a new one). Even though CoordPacker
        // sometimes has better documentation, GreasedRegion is generally a better choice; it was added to address
        // shortcomings in CoordPacker, particularly for speed, and the worst-case scenarios for data in CoordPacker are
        // no problem whatsoever for GreasedRegion. CoordPacker is called that because it compresses the information
        // for nearby Coords into a smaller amount of memory. GreasedRegion is called that because it encodes regions,
        // but is "greasy" both in the fatty-food sense of using more space, and in the "greased lightning" sense of
        // being especially fast. Both of them can be seen as storing regions of points in 2D space as "on" and "off."

// An explanation of hexadecimal float/double literals was mentioned earlier, so here it is.
// The literal 0x1p-9f is a good example; it is essentially the same as writing 0.001953125f,
// (float)Math.pow(2.0, -9.0), or (1f / 512f), but is possibly faster than the last two if the
// compiler can't optimize float division effectively, and is a good tool to have because these
// hexadecimal float or double literals always represent numbers accurately. To contrast,
// 0.3 - 0.2 is not equal to 0.1 with doubles, because tenths are inaccurate with floats and
// doubles, and hex literals won't have the option to write an inaccurate float or double.
// There's some slightly confusing syntax used to write these literals; the 0x means the first
// part uses hex digits (0123456789ABCDEF), but the p is not a hex digit and is used to start
// the "p is for power" exponent section. In the example, I used -9 for the power; this is a
// base 10 number, and is used to mean a power of 2 that the hex digits will be multiplied by.
// Because the -9 is a base 10 number, the f at the end is not a hex digit, and actually just
// means the literal is a float, in the same way 1.5f is a float. 2.0 to the -9 is the same as
// 1.0 / Math.pow(2.0, 9.0), but re-calculating Math.pow() is considerably slower if you run it
// for every cell during every frame. Though this is most useful for negative exponents because
// there are a lot of numbers after the decimal point to write out with 0.001953125 or the like,
// it is also sometimes handy when you have an integer or long written in hexadecimal and want
// to make it a float or double. You could use the hex long 0x9E3779B9L, for instance, but to
// write that as a double you would use 0x9E3779B9p0 , not the invalid syntax 0x9E3779B9.0 .
// We use p0 there because 2 to the 0 is 1, so multiplying by 1 gets us the same hex number.
// Very large numbers can also benefit by using a large positive exponent; using p10 and p+10
// as the last part of a hex literal are equivalent. You can see the hex literal for any given
// float with Float.toHexString(float), or for a double with Double.toHexString(double) .
// SColor provides the packed float versions of all color constants as hex literals in the
// documentation for each SColor.
