/**
 * This is a small, not-overly-simple demo that presents some important features of SquidLib and shows a faster,
 * cleaner, and more recently-introduced way of displaying the map and other text. Features include dungeon map
 * generation, field of view, pathfinding (to the mouse position), simplex noise (used for a flickering torch effect),
 * language generation/ciphering, a colorful glow effect, and ever-present random number generation (with a seed).
 * You can increase the size of the map on most target platforms (but GWT struggles with large... anything) by
 * changing gridHeight and gridWidth to affect the visible area or bigWidth and bigHeight to adjust the size of the
 * dungeon you can move through, with the camera following your '@' symbol.

        // shortcomings in CoordPacker, particularly for speed, and the worst-case scenarios for data in CoordPacker are
        // no problem whatsoever for GreasedRegion. CoordPacker is called that because it compresses the information
        // for nearby Coords into a smaller amount of memory. GreasedRegion is called that because it encodes regions,

        // being especially fast. Both of them can be seen as storing regions of points in 2D space as "on" and "off."
