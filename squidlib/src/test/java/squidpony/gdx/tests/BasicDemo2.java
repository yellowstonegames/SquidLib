/**
 * The main class of the game, constructed once in each of the platform-specific Launcher classes. Doesn't use any
 * platform-specific code.
 */
// If this is an example project in SquidSetup, then squidlib-util (the core of squidlib's logic code, including
// map generation and pathfinding), RegExodus (a dependency of squidlib-util, used for validating generated text and
// some other usages in a way that works cross-platform) and the squidlib (the text-based display module) are always
// dependencies. If you didn't change those dependencies, this class should run out of the box.
//
// This class is useful as a starting point, since it has dungeon generation and some of the trickier parts of input
// handling (using the mouse to get a path for the player) already filled in. You can remove any imports or usages of
// classes that you don't need.

// A main game class that uses LibGDX to display, which is the default for SquidLib, needs to extend ApplicationAdapter
// or something related, like Game. Game adds features that SquidLib doesn't currently use, so ApplicationAdapter is
// perfectly fine for these uses.

    //gridHeight is 30 because that variable will be used for generating the dungeon and handling movement within
    //the upper 30 rows. The bonusHeight is the number of additional rows that aren't handled like the dungeon rows for
    //UI reasons; here we show text generation in them. Next is gridWidth, which is 100 because we want 100 grid spaces
    //across the whole screen. cellWidth and cellHeight are 10 and 17, which will match the starting dimensions of a
    //cell, but won't be stuck at that value because we use a "stretchable" font, and the cells can change size. While
    //gridWidth and gridHeight are measured in spaces on the grid, cellWidth and cellHeight are the initial pixel
    //dimensions of one cell. If the screen is resized, one pixel on the original screen will take up more or less
    //space on the resized screen, but the same measurements will be used (usually called world coordinates by libGDX).
    //Most stretchable fonts supplied with SquidLib are distance field fonts (also called SDF, signed distance field).
    //SDF fonts can shrink to fairly small sizes while remaining reasonably readable, but are always a little blurry.
    //In this case we use a variant on that technique called MSDF, or multi-channel signed distance field, which
    //doesn't shrink to small sizes as nicely but zooms to larger sizes extremely well, with a "crisp" appearance on
    //corners, and is also faster to render because the shader it uses internally is simpler.

        // floors. The two kinds of such storage used commonly in SquidLib are the "packed data" as short[] produced by

        // shortcomings in CoordPacker, particularly for speed, and the worst-case scenarios for data in CoordPacker are
        // no problem whatsoever for GreasedRegion. CoordPacker is called that because it compresses the information
        // for nearby Coords into a smaller amount of memory. GreasedRegion is called that because it encodes regions,
        // but is "greasy" both in the fatty-food sense of using more space, and in the "greased lightning" sense of
        // being especially fast. Both of them can be seen as storing regions of points in 2D space as "on" and "off."
