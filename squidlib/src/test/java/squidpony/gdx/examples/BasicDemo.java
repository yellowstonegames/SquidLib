        // choose x and y positions until a floor is found, but particularly on dungeons with few floor cells, this can
        // have serious problems -- if it takes too long to find a floor cell, either it needs to be able to figure out
        // that random choice isn't working and instead choose the first it finds in simple iteration, or potentially
        // keep trying forever on an all-wall map. There are better ways! These involve using a kind of specific storage
        // for points or regions, getting that to store only floors, and finding a random cell from that collection of
        // floors. The two kinds of such storage used commonly in SquidLib are the "packed data" as short[] produced by
        // CoordPacker (which use very little memory, but can be slow, and are treated as unchanging by CoordPacker so
        // any change makes a new array), and GreasedRegion objects (which use slightly more memory, tend to be faster
        // on almost all operations compared to the same operations with CoordPacker, and default to changing the
        // GreasedRegion object when you call a method on it instead of making a new one). Even though CoordPacker
        // sometimes has better documentation, GreasedRegion is generally a better choice; it was added to address
        // shortcomings in CoordPacker, particularly for speed, and the worst-case scenarios for data in CoordPacker are
        // no problem whatsoever for GreasedRegion. CoordPacker is called that because it compresses the information
        // for nearby Coords into a smaller amount of memory. GreasedRegion is called that because it encodes regions,
        // but is "greasy" both in the fatty-food sense of using more space, and in the "greased lightning" sense of
        // being especially fast. Both of them can be seen as storing regions of points in 2D space as "on" and "off."

        GreasedRegion placement = new GreasedRegion(bareDungeon, '.');
        //player is, here, just a Coord that stores his position. In a real game, you would probably have a class for

        // in that region that is "on," or -1,-1 if there are no such cells. It takes an RNG object as a parameter, and
