/**
 * Augmented version of libGDX's Json class that knows how to handle various data types common in SquidLib.
 * This includes OrderedMap, which notably allows non-String keys (libGDX's default Map serializer requires keys to be
 * Strings), but does not currently allow the IHasher to be set (which only should affect OrderedMaps with array keys).
 * It also makes significantly shorter serialized output for 2D char arrays, GreasedRegion and FakeLanguageGen objects,
 * and various collections (IntDoubleOrderedMap, IntVLA, Arrangement, K2, and K2V1 at least).
 * Created by Tommy Ettinger on 1/9/2017.
