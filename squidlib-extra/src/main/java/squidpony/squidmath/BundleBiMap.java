/**
 * An ordered bidirectional map-like data structure, with "bundles" of unique E (for Element) keys and unique S (for
 * Single) keys updated together like a map that can be queried by E key bundles, S keys, or int indices, as well as
 * like a multimap that can be queried by lone E keys. A bundle can be specified as a Collection of E values, an array
 * of E values, or in two parts as either of the above given to a BundleBiMap method along with an int array that can
 * represent variations on E keys (e.g. some quantity for an E value that permits different amounts to be passed with
 * the unique E values to getS and have it yield a different S for a, say, 1 Foo and 1 Bar vs. 2 Foo and 3 Bar). This
 * allows an intended purpose for this class as a way to describe crafting recipes that may need various amounts of an
 * item to be mixed in, and since the quantities are optional, it can still be used to group multiple E keys with S
 * keys. The multimap property allows you to use an E element key to get all of the S keys that are associated with a
 * bundle that contains that E key (you can also get the ordering indices for those S keys, which you can use to get the
 * full bundle if you want).
 * <br>
 * Does not implement any interfaces that you would expect for a data structure, because almost every method it has
 * needs to specify whether it applies to E or S items, or otherwise doesn't fit a normal Collection-like interface's
 * requirements.
 * <br>
 * Closely related to Arrangement, K2, and K2V1 in implementation.
