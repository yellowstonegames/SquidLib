/**
 * An ordered multi-directional "map" that keeps 1 or more keysets organized so you can look up one key given a key in
 * another keyset, and do the same for the indices of keys. Does not have generic type parameters, which is needed
 * because we handle arbitrary counts of keysets, and each keyset could have its own type. You can use most of the
 * normal Map methods here, though they often need an int as their first argument, {@code which}, that specifies which
 * keyset the method applies to. For example, {@link #contains(int, Object)} checks for the presence of the second
 * parameter in the keyset specified by the first parameter. Adding items to a MultiKey uses {@link #put(Object...)},
 * and that does not take a {@code which} parameter because it needs to add an item to every keyset to succeed, and will
 * do nothing if the array or varargs passed to it has a different length than the {@link #keyCount} of the MultiKey.
